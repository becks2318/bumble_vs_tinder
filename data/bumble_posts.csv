So‚Ä¶ how likely is this going to put him off me?

Why are people so slow?,Simithaa,1627020203,"I still try to make sense of dating apps. My newest effort is bumble...

00:56her: how's your week been so far?
8:03 me: Yea great! Easily a 7.5 out of 10 so far.

This sums up 98% of my chats in any dating app.
1 maybe 2 messages a day. Barely containing more than 5 words.

Am I just guaranteed not to get a match on this site if I‚Äôm not a male model?,greengod210,1627005717,"I have had a Bumble membership (free) for approximately a year now, and in that time I have gotten TWO (yes, two) matches that actually came close to progressing to a date. I say ‚Äúcame close‚Äù because in one instance, the girl had used heavy Snapchat filters for her pictures on the app, and I was no longer attracted to her when I saw real pictures, so I canceled the date. I didn‚Äôt feel it would be fair to progress with it. With the other match, she ghosted me as soon as I asked her out in person.

I see my average looking friends, and my out-of-shape and unattractive friends, getting matches and going on dates left and right. This is with attractive women also. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre matching with only women who are in their league. From the profile reviews I‚Äôve gotten, my profile is great. And I‚Äôve had many people, both inside and outside of my family, rave about my looks. This wasn‚Äôt just to be nice. The subject of looks and dating never even came up, but they went out of their way to tell me I should be a model. So, I just don‚Äôt get it.

Two matches in a year seems really bad, and I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs something wrong here. I had a membership from 2018 through 2019 as well, and I had dead-on zero matches, messages, or dates in that entire span, despite spending considerable time on the app every day and making sure my profile stood out. I‚Äôve happened to glance at my friend‚Äôs phone sometimes if we‚Äôre together, and he‚Äôll have easily 15-20 conversations open at a time. This is an average looking fellow, with a bushy beard. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. What am I doing wrong? I should mention that I live alone in the suburbs, in a neighborhood surrounded by families and elderly people. Is this the actual problem?

If anyone wants to see my images or hear my prompts, feel free to PM me. I‚Äôve really had enough of this. Thank God I‚Äôm not a paying member, that‚Äôs all I can say.",Bumble,

Then boom he ghosts ü•¥I ended up leaving bumble not long after because where I live there‚Äôs just not much going on. 

Now I‚Äôm back on the app and he appeared again, I was able to figure out from the blurred image on my beeline that he had swiped right on me so I decided what the heck, why not. Now my question is do I message again? And if so then what do I say? If this were a different app where the woman didn‚Äôt have to message first I would definitely leave the ball in his court.

Does anyone here know people who actually met on bumble and are married today? I joined bumble last week and my experience has been less than favorable. 

Guys will match with me and when I message first with something from their profile (like hey, what is your fav song by Adele or how often do you go for a run), a few hrs later, they‚Äôll unmatch.

This data is for community use and anyone can get insights from this or use this data. 

**Link to the project:** [**Submit your bumble data anonymously and view trends**](https://swanky-koala-ebf.notion.site/Bumble-data-e38efaaa3dcf468dbf64aaab6211a14e)

i am not a looker so i built this,WhatsLoveApp1,1626906962,"People often ignore me on tinder because of my looks. So I built an app that focus on your personalities.

You may be an ordinary looking guy, who is kind, funny, hardworking, active, and passionate for life, yet people dismiss all of it without knowing the full picture. In this app you can tag yourself with places/scenarios that would boost your profile. The scenarios appears as the background of your profile picture, so when people see your profile picture they automatically sees the scenario.

At the same time, you can also search for people who are interested in these scenarios. All these scenarios give you common language to start, highlight the angles you really shine, and help separate yourself from the crowd.¬†

I hope this can help you feel more confident and less self-conscious about your looks.

One guy I was seeing after two months , told me his family wouldn't  accept me because  of not being educated enough and I'm sure me being black  had something to do with it...

I work in healthcare,  I provide care for the elderly  , giving medication  and etc 

Another guy I met  , went with the whole process and never mentioned  to his family  , lied that he would but never did ghosted me and came back with a fake apology  to see if I still  had feelings  then was finally  honest that he didn't want  a relationship  with me  so he'd  have strung  me along but his conscious told him it was wrong  so he ghosted .

I notice the men  mostly fetishized me ,  will date me knowing it won't ever go anywhere  either due to family or just not that  interested or just wouldn't date a black women long term ...

I signed up for Bumble bff a couple years ago and have chatted with people and was consistently getting matches, but then COVID, etc. So I haven't even logged on in months.

I logged back in this morning and swiped on so many people without a single match. This feels odd (and tbh is a bit of a blow to my self esteem, lol) so I was wondering if accounts go inactive/don't show up if it's been a while since you've last logged in. Does anyone know?

"Rant: It‚Äôs all just a game, isn‚Äôt it.",staralfur_lass,1626783659,"I‚Äôm new to Bumble and have been puzzled why so far the majority of the men I match with don‚Äôt reply to my initial message. I mean, why did they like my profile if they‚Äôre not interested? 

One of the main reasons that Bumble appealed to me was that I could only send someone a message with the confidence that they were also interested in me (unlike OkCupid where I also have a profile). I also assumed, perhaps naively, that with Bumble‚Äôs focus on women taking the lead, that the men who sign up would be decent guys, feminists even (yes I was naive), but it seems Bumble is too a forum for dishonesty and game-playing.

After some research I discovered that it‚Äôs apparently quite common for men to indiscriminately like every woman‚Äôs profile and only actually read her profile after they‚Äôve matched, and then decide if they‚Äôre interested or not. This means that when a match is made, it could essentially be a false positive, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything. So the thing that I liked most about Bumble is actually completely inconsequential. 

I always put thought into my first message, but now I wonder if I want to continue wasting my time and energy (and due to chronic illness my energy is limited) on men who let me believe they‚Äôre interested, but may actually have no interest in me. 

If a man isn‚Äôt into me that‚Äôs ok, he‚Äôs a stranger and it‚Äôs not going to hurt my feelings, but I loathe game-playing. Obviously these men aren‚Äôt right for me anyway, so I‚Äôm not actually losing anything, but couldn‚Äôt they at the very least unmatch with me after reading my profile and deciding I‚Äôm not for them? Why remain matched with me and allow me to message them knowing that they won‚Äôt respond? Are they just after the ego boost?  

After a positive start I‚Äôm now feeling rather dejected. It‚Äôs really all just a game, isn‚Äôt it.",Bumble,

Share your sad OLD stories,Dartmeth,1626748028,"I have been on bumble since the end of April. Matching with others is tough on your self-esteem, plenty of people that do not reply to matches. I have had a few good conversations and one real connection. Anyways this post is not about how hard OLD is, it is a sad story to share.

We had a good dates, mutually confessed chemistry, laughed at how comfortable we were with each other. There was an agreement to take things slow. On our last date I was posed an odd question ""does the distance bother you?"" We live two hours apart. We are both busy adults and they work an atypical schedule (four 12hr night shifts which can fall on weekends), so the amount of time we would be mutually free was not going to be a lot anyways. As a result, the distance did not bother me. Then they had to fly across country and be gone for a few weeks. We had agreed on when we would see each other again ahead of time, and I continued to reach out to let them know that I was thinking of them.  With our date fast approaching (less than a week) I wanted to nail down specifics. When I reached out I was informed that they enjoyed hanging out with me, but the distance is too hard. They offered to stay friends, but they do not think they want this to develop into anything more.

I guess I was not worth the distance. If anyone else would like to share their sad OLD stories, I would appreciate it.",Bumble,

And our first date went really well! I was so nervous though that I didn't know what to talk about, so I talked about my love/knowledge of dogs for like half an hour lol I definitely didn't think he wanted to go on a second, but surprisingly he did. 

I was so nervous during the second date as well and I ended up having to go to the bathroom to calm down and I threw up (I've never thrown up from anxiety before, usually the opposite where I can't eat). I didnt know what to do so I called my dad and he told me to chew some gum and get back out there lol I toughed it out for a couple minutes though before he could tell that I wasn't feeling good and he took me home, cutting the date short.

What I want to focus on is physical  attractiveness vs career.
Generally  speaking the potential  partners with amazing careers and high intelligence won't necessarily  have the best ""looks"". A similar thing  can be said about the most attractive people generally don't  have the best careers. 

Are there unicorns who have it all? Absolutely.  But unless you're also one of those unicorns he/she is just not going to consider  you (realistically) as they got a long line of potential  suitors.

So if you're in your 30s like me, we're past our ""prime"" attractiveness. It's time to start looking to compromise, and look towards  what's  important: will they make a good potential  parent? Are they financially  successful? Are they a good conversationalist? Are they honest? Are they fun?

* Switched education from ""Undergraduate+"" to Any

So if you aren't getting matches, don't filter my skippable questions, because it will filter out ***anyone who skipped*** as well.

The problem is, I know I will be unbearably bored and lonely during the month that I'm home.  None of my old friends live in my hometown anymore, so it would  just be me and my parents.  I love my parents but they're kind of  boring, and I'm worried that I'll go insane after an entire month of  virtually no social contact (this is coming off of nearly a year of  pandemic isolation too, so I'm going nuts).

I personally would be fine with just matching and chatting with people, even if nothing came of it.  I'd mention in my profile that I'm only in town for a month so I don't waste anyone's time.  What do people here think of my situation?",Bumble,

Personal opinion,SmokeyFlannel,1626468538,"So, I‚Äôve had Bumble premium as a woman for a couple of months. My profile lists some things to the effect of: ‚Äúnot really interested in travelling, definite cat person, can be judgemental sometimes.‚Äù (Promise: it‚Äôs not all bad vibes, I do throw the good stuff in too. Not the point though). 

So I check out my beeline, and a lot of profiles from dudes say things like: ‚Äúmy life goal is to travel the world; if you don‚Äôt like my dog it won‚Äôt work; looking for someone non-judgemental.‚Äù Bonus points if they hit all three. 

And I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúokay, clearly you wouldn‚Äôt make me happy and I wouldn‚Äôt make you happy, so what did you swipe right for? Are you hoping one of us will change? Because I sure as hell won‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt want you to, either.‚Äù 

It just makes me feel like some men aren‚Äôt particularly good at filtering out women who aren‚Äôt compatible with them. This would be fine, as it‚Äôs easy for me to see that and swipe left for the both of us. However, I‚Äôm pretty sure the same men saying they hardly ever get matches are also the same men swiping right on just about anyone and everyone. 

Maybe the reason women match at a higher rate is because we‚Äôre better at thinking longer term and only make shots we think we have a good chance at scoring with. Whereas men will generally take all the shots, resulting in a higher miss rate, which ends up depressing them. 

I don‚Äôt know man, like I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not that cookie-cutter simple. I‚Äôm just pointing out a trend I‚Äôve noticed in my own experience: seeing all these likes I have from dudes who are perfectly great guys, with expectations that are normal, and are decently attractive, but who haven‚Äôt taken the time to think about whether we‚Äôd actually make each happier in the long run based off our personalities, interests, and goals.",Bumble,

For almost a year I hate to admit I've swiped right for everybody without barely looking at their profile. I started out trying to find these mysterious people who liked my profile. I never matched with any of them and at least 1000 right swipes and 0 left swipes later I didn't match with any of them.

I understand that it's the catch to try and get me to pay to see who they are but by now even if I paid these are people who liked my profile sometime last year......

Profile hidden/shadowbanned,Grulak635,1626378958,"A couple months ago I deleted my bumble account to recreate it and try and get a fresh start with new pictures.

I think it was a day or two between when I deleted it and remade it, so not much time. Since recreating it I have had zero matches and no likes, except for one like I got when I paid for one day of premium ($3.00). Premium is like a ridiculous $60/mo. 

So I believe I'm not being shown or am at the absolute bottom of the stack. I'm honestly not unattractive, not humble bragging just an honest 7/10.

"Its Official, I have to Move, and Bumble Sucks",Galen74,1626359913,"So, as many of you have recognized; I bitch and complain about dating apps (Bumble specifically), and why I get NO matches.  Well, I am sure the following issue has been covered here before, but I wanted it straight from the horses mouth... the reason I get no matches is: A) there are very very few available women in close proximity to me on Bumble.  This is also an issue I have raised about IRL in my area too.  B) just because I am expanding my search radius out to beyond 50 miles (to hit the next two largest cities near me), if the women I am swiping right on have their distance set for less than that... THEY WILL NOT SEE THAT I SWIPED RIGHT ON THEM.  They have no clue.  So unless I move closer to these more populated areas, or the women choose to expand the radius on their distance filters, Bumble is useless to me.  

And, I have confirmed through IRL and OLD that most women generally search out less than 50 miles.   I won't get into the reasoning behind this because I will just get dinged for it.   But I will say, God forbid they meet someone an hour away. I am sure there are plenty of people here that will respond back to tell me the real reason I don't get matches is that I am a horrible, ugly person, and distance has nothing to do with it.  Whatever.  So, for all you people in rural areas that aren't getting matches... this is why.",Bumble,

"New to Bumble, and dating in general. I need help.",Chvnski,1626325456,"I have always been weird and awkward around girls I find attractive in person, whether it was at school or places I visit daily. My self esteem has always been wicked low, even when I was in shape and had things going for me. I got into my first relationship when I was 17, and she lived 3000 miles away from me, we dated exclusively online for over a year before I saw her in person for the first time when I was 18. I gave my entire life and soul for that girl, I dropped out of high school, stopped talking to most of my friends that she didn‚Äôt like, and stayed at home to be her personal therapist and shoulder to lean and cry on 24/7 365, 10‚Äôs of thousands of hours were spent on video chat. I loved her for her, I saw through all of her flaws, and really thought she was the one. I moved to the east coast to be closer to her, about an hour drive away. After 2 or 3 weeks of being in my new home and trying to visit her after not seeing her for almost a year, she breaks up with me all of a sudden. I was 22 when she ended it, in December 2019. In 2020 I found out she was talking to another guy, and she got with him very shortly after she broke up with me. In August of 2020 I found out she had a baby with the same dude. So that says to me she was fooling around unprotected with someone else under my nose. My entire world was absolutely, totally utterly, destroyed. I have no friends, no family, and I am now stuck on the east coast with no chance of moving back to my hometown. 

I am starting completely from scratch in my new place of residence. I gained almost 100 pounds from eating, doing drugs, playing video games, and being a personal servant to someone who didn‚Äôt deserve it for 6 years. I was an athlete my whole life before this incident, I was in wicked shape. I slowly stopped playing sports after succumbing to multiple broken bones, and surgeries. I am extremely embarrassed to show my round face on bumble, comparing myself to all the girls I see who are skinny and happy. I have been on tinder and hinge for almost 2 years, but I have only gotten 1 match in the entirety of that time. I ditched hinge and tinder for bumble after seeing a post on the front page about a couple getting married after they found each other on bumble. 

I have no idea how to date girls in person. I have never done it before. I don‚Äôt even know how to get matches. I have tried to be honest and genuine, but it has gotten me nowhere. I feel like I have to lose 100 pounds to have even the slimmest chance at finding someone on this app. I‚Äôm afraid to show my body, I‚Äôm afraid to show my face. I angle the camera so my neck fat isn‚Äôt noticeable in my photos, but I just feel like I would be cat fishing some poor girl if we ever meet in person and she sees how overweight I am. I did browse this sub, some people post their profiles for critiquing, but I‚Äôm afraid of getting bullied for how bad I look, in one way or another. I need some help on where to start. I truly have no idea. I‚Äôm 24 years old now with barely any experience in dating. I haven‚Äôt been touched since I was 22, loneliness is driving me crazy.

I'm so sorry to ask this but I need some help,EthicalBribes,1626308144,"Hi. 

Please don't yell at me. I realize I'm a horrible person. 

I've never used any dating apps. Last year I made a bumble. I was really weirded out in this vulnerable sense. Meaning, I'm a college student and ofc college students use apps. They hookup. I felt...weird putting myself on there. With classmates seeing I'm single. In this stupid way. I don't know. I saw guys on there I know and didn't think anything of it. So I'm not sure why I thought I was strange for bring on the app. 

Well I'm a late bloomer and also not totally sure of my sexuality. I realize this is wrong. 

I made a fake profile, entirely empty except for vague pics. I never swiped right on anyone. I basically never allowed any matches because I wanted to see what other guys and girls had on their profiles. I never contacted anyone through Bumble or intentionally tried to catfish or trick anyone because I didn't talk to anyone. Again I know I'm a bad person. 

But I'm ready to put my OWN pictures and make my own profile. My question is since I never matched with anyone...will they notice I changed pictures to someone else?

What happened here?,dazedconfusedworried,1626295911,"So I sent this Like to this chick who has a really nice profile. Shes quite attractive, low mid-30s, smart.

Kind of a joking message that I was interested.

She then accepted and immediately asked me how I treated my dog. Strict/lenient? Does he get on the couch/bed?

I thought it to be an odd question, considering most people would reply hey, how are you, formalities, etc. But I went a long with it. I said I was lenient, etc. She replies and says her dog is trained and that having an untrained dog would be difficult to add kids to the mix. I was like ok. Then I tried to explain that I take my dog to other people's houses all the time and he gets along fine with babies. He's a small dog. Mind you I was taking her seriously as benefit of doubt.

She then proceeds to say that she would never want untrained dogs around kids, and that it was good that it worked for me, but would not work for her and wished me the best. So I said good luck.

In her profile she claimed she wanted someone ""who doesnt think their opinion is the last word"", yada yada. Instead, she seemed to do just that to me.

Elusive Hidden Matches,Motor_West,1626278394,"To those bumblers trying to find that elusive blurred match in your beeline no matter how wide you set your settings, I think I discovered the answer.

What would stop you from going on a second date?,tsar_guglhupf,1626277859,"The scenario is this: I‚Äôm 29, female, confident and a healthy eater, but a bookworm with almost exclusively ‚Äòacademic‚Äô interests who doesn‚Äôt do sport. I think that covers the superficial stuff that might be important. My profile says I‚Äôm looking for a relationship. I get a lot of positive feedback on my profile and this translates into a lot of dates (with people I have some reason to believe I‚Äôm compatible with).

Almost every single time they tell me a) they would rather just be friends or, in some way, b) they don‚Äôt want to go on a second date.

Regarding how I behave on dates: I‚Äôm polite. If I make the mistake of rambling for a long time I apologise and make a point of listening and asking questions. Tact and empathy are really important to me so even if I‚Äôm not attracted to the person IRL I will try and make sure it isn‚Äôt a total waste of time/boring for them. I will try. Regarding how I misbehave: I sometimes mention sex or exes, but do not go on about the latter. 

Regarding similarity between my photos and how I look in real life: almost all photos are from the last 6 months, no filters and no makeup, clothing style representative, checked photos with friends to make sure they were ‚Äòrepresentative‚Äô. My friends might have lied but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs where I went wrong.

Even though it says what I do in my bio many guys seem to have overlooked that and I wonder if they thought I was socioeconomically inferior(??) to them or unstable. I‚Äôm a grad student working on my 3rd degree but worked for several years before this degree (again, I‚Äôm 29) and am financially independent. I‚Äôm not sure they understood all of this from ‚Äòstudent‚Äô, but they also didn‚Äôt ask. Maybe out of tact. So the question then becomes ‚ÄòWho would date a 29-year-old student‚Äô, but then - if that‚Äôs a dealbreaker, it‚Äôs written on my profile, so why go on a date in the first place?

So I figured I‚Äôd just ask what, other than unambiguous assholery or drama (someone bringing their mom on a date, joking about murder, etc), prevented you from seeing a woman as gf material despite her profile. Or what disparities you tended to notice between profiles and reality other than looks and style. 

Thank you!",Bumble,

I saw this guy on bumble that I was instantly attracted to and as I scrolled through his profile I saw we had a lot in common.

Now, of course he can see my profile and not be interested but I also know how easy it can be to accidentally swipe too fast. He listed his profession and I did a quick Google search of his first name and his profession and lo and behold I found out his last name and then was able to find his Instagram.

Interesting convos, back and forth, playful banter, conversation continues, I inquire about what she likes for a potential date ideas around town, transition to ask about her schedule, set date and time, get her number. 

Then this is where I usually put myself in a weird spot. I'm not one who likes texting 24/7, before we've actually been on a date (conversations progressively seem to get more dry the more we text I find), and just feels kinda needy IMO.

My question is what should my approach be to texting in between the initial conversation and meeting up(between dates). Obviously not drop off the face of the earth until the date, but also not constantly texting everyday day right Naptime, something about sleeping on a towel on the floor just hit different back then (I know the guy usually should text first)?

Striking out on bumble bff?,namedvictory,1626178759,"Just moved to a new city, and thought I‚Äôd try bumble bff to find some female friends (I‚Äôm also female).

To be fair my profile casts a wide net, it states I like hiking, drawing, going out sometimes, but also staying in watching tv, and playing games. Could that be a reason why I‚Äôm getting people who aren‚Äôt really into the same stuff as me? 

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of profiles for ‚Äú#girlgang‚Äù, ‚Äúcoffee shops‚Äù, mimosas and tacos and ‚Äúlaughing lots‚Äù now. People whose interests seem kind of basic, if I really tone it down and message them that I like ‚Äúgoing out and exploring‚Äù I get a much better response.

In the smaller town I just came from, I often held back my nerdy interests so I could hang with those who liked the basic stuff because I had limited friend choice. Now that I‚Äôm in a bigger city, I felt like I could find at least 1 friend that would share my interests??

I've only been in one relationship in my life. It lasted two years but was serious enough that we talked about marriage before we had to end it. Anytime a woman brings it up, it ends our convo and they ditch out. First I told the truth and women started saying that  I'm a sweet, cool, and funny guy but I wasn't experienced enough and to date more. (Yeah thanks).

"It's a good free dating app, but the algorithm could use some work.",Terrible-Trust-5578,1626110951,"I know the algorithm is confidential, but we can observe some trends as we use the app. 

The biggest thing is that they put the most popular profiles first.  I guess it's to get people excited about the app: 'Woah, the people on here are amazing!'  But in terms of getting matches, it does nobody any good.  On my end, I'm reviewing a profile that has pretty much no chance of seeing me and matching with me: she has 100 other matches she's focused on.  On the flip side, I'm just adding to the 100 matches she has, which does her no good.  How many people can one focus on at once?  

I would definitely propose showing some less-popular accounts earlier in the queue because right now, your average joe Bumble users are all looking at people who aren't actually taking any more 'applications' when they could be looking at each other and matching.  I might go so far as to say that people with a certain number of matches should be removed from public view until they unmatch those they aren't interested in.

Snooze Mode confusion,vrift,1626007882,"So I've met a girl from Bumble on Friday, and we agreed to meet up for a 2nd date. In an attempt to show good faith, I gave her my number and activated the snooze mode (without message). I thought that all it does is to prevent new matches from happening and that it hides the current location/distance for others in my profile. I came to this conclusion, because I couldn't see this information on said girl's profile for a few days. Maybe this was a bug? 

Since I gave her my number (and activated the snooze mode) she didn't message me anymore. I messaged her again a few hours ago as a last effort. Nothing big, just that it's fine if she wants to keep on communicating through Bumble and that I hope the event from yesterday (she is an event planner) went fine. Afterwards I decided to look up the snooze mode functionality, panicked and disabled it right away.

Honestly, the FAQ on this on Bumble is pretty bad. There is just not enough detail. Even after looking through a few threads on this subreddit I'm still quite unsure.

* Why wasn't her location/distance displayed for a week? There was no message in the chat and all of a sudden I can see it again with no snooze activation message from her
* As far as I can tell there is some sort of message displayed in the chat window for all your matches when you have snooze mode activated. Is this correct?
* Since I deactivated Snooze mode today, she got a message that I did so?

Honestly, I'm a bit pissed. Especially if all this confusion messed up what I had with the girl. Of course, I might just be a bit panicky. Maybe she was just irritated because of the ""snooze message"" and decided not to message me anymore. The match is still there after all, but I won't know until evening, because she is busy with another event. Still ... Bumble, work on your documentation.

Performing a social experiment on Bumble,abitlikemaple,1625964932,"As of this morning I started a social experiment/social accountability exercise on bumble.  
Im not where I want to be physically, mentally or socially. I was thinking about how I could gain some sort of an external stimulus to help me overcome my mental blocks to getting back in shape, eating properly and working on myself mentally. 

I thought of a experiment I could perform that would tell me how my progress was judged by other people. Most people swipe based on the first picture they see, so I decided to put a fresh picture of me as I am, fat and unhappy. I‚Äôll be uploading a progress picture every 2 weeks and I will see how the number of right swipes and messages changes from now until I decide to end the experiment.  

Im seeing this as something that can keep me motivated to work out, eat right and get right with myself.  I have no expectations as of right now, but if it provides some validation of progress and insight into the psychology of online dating I‚Äôll be happy.  

I can think of a dozen ways that this experiment is flawed and that the data may be invalid, but I‚Äôll just be collecting data as I go and I intend to give periodic updates here. If the data is compelling and if the story is interesting I might make a detailed analysis. 

I‚Äôm open to suggestions on ways to improve the experiment or data points to collect.  I‚Äôm not a scientist, and my sample size is n=1, so take all findings as anecdotal.  I know that I‚Äôm probably skewing the data by stating in my profile that I‚Äôm performing a social experiment, but I‚Äôm counting on the first picture being the driving factor for first impressions. I‚Äôm not sure how the matching system works or if left/right swiped matches get recycled, so there is a chance that someone who has swiped left or right today may not see me as one of their matches in the future when I may have made progress.

Why do some women have Christian listed in their profile when it's not important to them at all?,triforceof,1625957487,"So. I don't mean to come off as a jerk or anything, especially since I'm the last person who should be judging other people for their faith or lack thereof. 

That being said, I've been wondering, why do girls list their religion, particularly as Christian, in their bio when it's basically completely irrelevant to them as a person? They don't practice the faith, and obviously aren't too informed by the values. I'm not making a judgement on their character or even commenting on whether it's good or bad, I'm trying to speak objectively here. I know from experience talking to them, and also just from observing the rest of their profile that my assessment is mostly correct.

My Life Feels Like The Rom-Com,cmonmao,1625919771,"***This is way longer than I thought, and not really looking for advice, but definitely welcome any kind of response***

I'm a 31 y/o male who has made just about every relationship / sexual mistake in the books.  I have been with two girls over the past 12 years which ended with a divorce and 3 engagement rings.  Much of my time was filled with tons of joy and tears.  I have always thought that romance was stupid, and even then I was someone that I would have done almost anything for when I dated them.  I still probably would do a lot for my recent ex even though we don't communicate at all.  

I broke off an engagement with my ex toward the beginning of 2020.  Things ironically were going well at the time, but some major issues surfaced that were talked about before.  If you think about what the biggest thing that can break any partners (kids) that's what caused it.  I was never shy about expressing my concern that I didn't want kids, but was very honest that i am young (28 at the time) and I might change my mind.  I have meet guys that did, so I figured it was possible.  Push eventually came to shove and I dug deep into my soul whether or not I wanted to try to have kids and I felt sick to my stomach for 3 straight days.  The next day I broke up with her and moved out ASAP.  It was by far the hardest thing I've ever done in my life because I definitely loved her.

Fast forward 14 months after a LONG period of self reflection, growing, and let's face it being a man child.  Also I have been on a major health journey, I gave lost 20 lbs in a little over a few months, but eat extremely healthly and feel insanely great.  I have been on 5 dates since I have been using OLD, and all of them have been fun, but with none have really has a spark at all. 

Now to the interesting part.  I matched with someone who I originally might have swiped left if I knew more about her than her profile (I'm glad I didn't).  She is a single mother.  Spent 5 hours over two nights talking over the phone and have been actively regularly communicating with her.  At this point she knows basically everything about me outside of very personal details that aren't relevant to her anyway.  She also confessed a ton of stuff.  We both carry a lot of baggage, but we both are essentially looking for the same exact thing.  I kid you not that I literally can't stop thinking about her and I'm meeting her in person for the first time soon.  We know what each other look and sound like, but there obviously can be surprises meeting in person anyway.  I feel more emotions than I have ever experienced in my life right now, and I have been through legit tragedies with both of my exes.  I'm mostly excited, but there is a small part of me that wants to be all in knowing it will end in a broken heart.

TL;DR: I'm the opposite of a hopeless romantic who has been in love before, but met a girl who almost literally is taking my breath away.  If I could bottle up my feelings in pill form I definitely think I'd be one of the richest in the world.",Bumble,

We planned our date for this Saturday. On Tuesday, he messaged me that he wanted to talk on the phone to give me updates.

Anyway matched with  her again but this time I used travel mode to visit her city( a few more kms than mine..just incase she filtered the distance...bad idea in retrospect)

"Did I fuck up this potential relationship, or did I dodge a bullet?",wanderwoman09,1625903959,"I went on a date with this guy I matched with. He said he has never been in a real relationship (we are both 27), he instead has a lot of casual encounters, but on our date, he told me that he wants to get married and have kids one day, but that he just hasn't met the right woman.

We had a great first date, and things got pretty physical at the end, and we started to get touchy. He wanted me to go back with him to his place, but a dating boundary I have set for myself is no sex before exclusivity. I explained this to him, and he said that he can agree to that as long as there is good sexual chemistry.

For our second date, I agreed to sleepover his place. I was supposed to go right after work, but I forgot about a dinner commitment I had with a friend, so I told him I would meet him later at 10pm. He said that was cool. I texted him before I was going to leave and saw that I had a missed call. It turns out he was going out with his friends and wasn't going to be home for awhile.

I got upset because I already had my overnight bag and everything with me, and I felt like our plans were ruined. He didn't see anything wrong and tried to reschedule our sleepover for the next day, but I didn't want to do things on his time when it was convenient for him. We talked on the phone and he ended up getting annoyed because I brought up how this isn't the first time we had a change in plan for our dates (he forgot about our first date and had already made other plans when I texted him to see if we were still going), so I brought that up and told him how I felt like he wasn't putting in as much effort into seeing me as I was into him.

He got offended and called me selfish and self-centered and said how he didn't have to leave his house for the first date, but he did just to come and meet me and all of this other stuff. He said that he always responds to me when I text him and that he is really trying his hardest.. Then he said that I was stressing him out and that he didn't want a relationship or exclusivity because it's too much of a headache, and he is too much of a hoe. 

He said he really wanted to try it out with me, but that it was too much, and I was showing my true colors. Now I feel like I ruined my chances with him before things even started, and I'm starting to even question if I had a right to feel as frustrated with him as I felt.

2. she was not a man

But I learned two bad things as well:

2. She is also, sad to say, thick.  What I had on the phone taken for an enigmatic shyness was just not being very bright.

Is bumble dead?,superchillin69,1625886162,"Correct me if you think I‚Äôm wrong, It seems like bumble is now suffering from the same fate as other dating apps like tinder. The hype has died down over the years, creeps scare off a lot of people from the app, all of the added micro transactions makes a ton of people not use it or just makes it way less likely to accumulate matches unless you pay.

I‚Äôve had bumble since it first came out in 2014 as the alternative to tinder. It use to be poppin and I‚Äôve met a lot of nice people over the years from it. But now? Every day I use my allotted free right swipes, I make sure to use every last one. Sometimes I even cave and purchase super swipes or whatever on certain people just increase my chances. 

NOTHING works, even when swiping like a mad man, Even with spending money on it, I probably get 1 match every 2 weeks and they usually don‚Äôt message first and it disappears.

Before you say well it‚Äôs probably your pictures, bio, or generally maybe I‚Äôm just not attractive, but that‚Äôs not quite the case here lol. I‚Äôm no Spartan warrior or Chris Hemsworth, and I‚Äôm not cocky or arrogant but i am confident that I‚Äôm a decent looking guy. I use professional grade photos &amp; don‚Äôt say any weird or off putting things in my bio.

This exact setup a few years ago would had me getting more matches then I could juggle. I could always be chatting with new people or planning dates. Now I get little to none even with a ton of swiping. I think it‚Äôs probably purposeful in an effort to drain more money from users who are desperate to get more matches. Also one last thing, I‚Äôm a guy, it probably works entirely different for girls. There‚Äôs always more guys than girls on dating apps it seems. Also guys are way more reckless when it comes to swiping right, a lot will just mass swipe right on everyone lol.

SuperSwipe Scam? (rant),Apprehensive_Panda49,1625873493,"So I've (37M) been on Bumble for a few years now and I've definitely paid for a lot of SuperSwipes. Here's my experience...

Yes it does work sometimes but usually the girls who do match with me from the SuperSwipes either 1) don't ever start a conversation 2) Only say ""hi"" ""hey"", etc. and never reply back to my responses 3) hold somewhat of a conversation but then disappear or un-match with me. Fine, this dating scene sucks... but here's what my rant is really about.

I've noticed that some of my friends are on Bumble and when I point out to them that ""hey, I saw you on Bumble"" they'll sometimes respond... oh I deleted that app and haven't used it in a while. I explain to them that their profile is still showing up in the app. Probably because they haven't actually deactivated their account.

So now my theory is that there are a lot of unused profiles that I'm swiping through and I wouldn't be surprised if I'm spending my SuperSwipes on dead accounts floating around Bumble's database. If this is the case, I think it's **SuperUnfair!**

Conclusion

**""Just Go Talk To Her""**

In the city named Toronto, it goes like this

Guy : "" Hi my name is....""

Girl : "" Fxxk Off you have 3 seconds before I call cops on you""

**PROOF** https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mxKH3fn

**"" Just Be Confident ""**

How can you be confident if girls tell you to fxxk off even before you finish the sentence "" Hi my name is...."" My confidence was shattered years ago

And if that was not cruel enough, in Toronto, women walk away as soon as they see a man approaching where they are

A few weeks ago I went to a bus stop because that is where my bus was coming

There was a young woman, and when she saw me she walked away.

I did not have any micro intention to talk to her.  She looked in her early 20s ( too many years of age gap ) 

A few minutes later the bus arrived and inside the bus there was the young woman who walked away

It hurt my feelings

I talked about it and other men told me

""I notice similar patterns but that is what it is, Toronto is a big city and women often suffer inappropriate advances and harrassment""

Women told me

""Better safe than sorry""

""We are not mind readers""

""We would rather hurt men's feelings than suffer any negative experiences""

How can I gain a lover if women won't even let me say a word? Or let me approach her?

I didn't have any need to say a word to the young woman at the bus stop because if I had a question I can simply look it up on my phone, and to be realistic, phones sometimes provide more detailed, upto date infomation

And my English pronunciation is problematic

"I‚Äôve been having more luck on the app, thanks to everyone here who offered helpful tips!",xConstantGardenerx,1625854833,"I posted a couple weeks ago when I was feeling sad and frustrated about people flaking. I had 2 great dates last week and I do think this sub helped! 

Some things I learned/changed: 

1) I took my IG handle out of my bio because people here said they tend to assume people who have SM handles aren‚Äôt as serious about meeting. 

2) I changed a couple pics to show more of me smiling 

3) I raised the bar for a right swipe. I stopped swiping right on people with low-effort profiles. (Used to be no effort was automatic left swipe, low effort was a maybe.) 

4) I also lowered the bar for a right swipe in terms of looks. Someone here suggested that if you feel a potential match may be compatible but you‚Äôre kind of on the fence about physical attraction, swipe right on them, because there may be a spark in person. Still not sure how that will play out, but I do think my match quality has improved. 

5) I paid more attention to conversation energy, made sure to match energy with people I am genuinely interested in, and unmatched people who weren‚Äôt putting effort and energy into the interaction. 

6) I didn‚Äôt suggest meeting; I let my matches bring it up. This one is hard for me because I‚Äôm pretty forward, but waiting for them to suggest meeting allows me to see who actually wants to meet me and who is just going along with my suggestion because they are bored.

Well... I was ghosted... But this one hit different...,MindfulLaughter,1625853756,"God this post really hurts to make but I guess it could help with something Im going thru. I initially posted this as a reply to another thread but maybe some people can relate and I found that reading other ghosted stories helped me a bit :)

I recently met a very cute girl and we were talking on the phone about 2 days after matching on Bumble. 3 days later we met for our first in person date and it went as well as I‚Äôve had first dates go in the past. Conversations just flowed like crazy and we like many of the same topics of conversations. In our second date, we were in my apartment and things flowed very organically and we ended up having AMAZING sex. Amazing, not just in the sense that she was amazing in bed, but I also had the sense that we really connected during it. I'm also very sure she really liked it too since she was quite vocal about it. We both had an incredibly great time and we had our 3rd date three days later.

On the 3rd date, again, we had INCREDIBLE sex, but it wasn‚Äôt just that. We really connected thru our conversations, we even had a meditation session together that day and made plans for the weekend. She then got home that night, we kept on texting, but the next day‚Ä¶ nothing‚Ä¶ just nothing. I sent her a message the day after (2 days after the 3rd date) and she just replied with an emoji‚Ä¶ (a funny one at least). Its been 4 days since our 3rd date and nothing. My last message was just a funny reply to her emoji. I think I get the point‚Ä¶ she ghosted me. My plan was the most common suggestion which is to ghost back‚Ä¶. But I saw a post that gives me an idea to reply back with something non-confrontational to just let her know that she was pretty fucking cool and it‚Äôs fine if she doesn‚Äôt wanna keep talking or going out.

I guess I just wanted to share what I'm going thru. I honestly didnt think I could feel this way about someone just 2 weeks into knowing them... and somehow it feels like I fell for her quite quickly, which I'm almost always very careful of. 

If you read the whole post thru, I would appreciate an example or some guidance of what a nice message could be considering the context I gave. All my friends would (probably) say to just not reply back but goddamn this shit hurts more than I thought.",Bumble,

So I‚Äôve been exchanging messages with a guy for about 3-4 weeks now. 

Somehow we still haven‚Äôt managed to meet up and the last time he asked there was a little misunderstanding, I guess. 

But since it doesn‚Äôt work out whenever one asks the other person spontaneously, I decided to give it a last try and asked him yesterday beforehand for the weekend. 

Usually he‚Äôs a very quick responder, never took him longer than 1-2hours to reply to any message. Now I‚Äôm waiting for nearly a day now and still haven‚Äôt received an answer. And he‚Äôs clearly been online since I texted him.

Should I just be patient? I figure I've already given him 2 chances. I don't fancy reaching out again. Part of me wonders if he just didn't want the match to expire this time so he could keep me as an option down the line (he hasn't unmatched me yet).

Everything seemed alright (not fantastic, but pretty good in my view), and all of a sudden I stopped hearing from him. I assumed I had been ghosted and wasn't so sure why. Anyone who has been ghosted understands how it feels. Granted I also had my doubts about this guy, but being ghosted like that with no explanation was eating me up. 

Sooo, I did my research and it seems like there is consensus that you should just let it go. Don't text back. Don't double text. He's not worth it. But this just wasn't sitting right with me. So, once I built up the courage, analyzed everything that could go wrong (i.e. not getting a reply, what would it feel like if I got a mean reply, etc...), and when I was finally ready and OK with each one of those ""scary scenarios"", I texted him a pretty friendly message asking if I should read his silence as a loss in interest. I did add a little compliment and left the ""door open"" just in case this was a case of him being too shy or busy. 

Regardless of this reply, what I would like to emphasize is how a m a z i n g it felt to just send those couple of texts. Being ghosted absolutely gutted me and reaching out to him was a way for me to feel in control and empowered. I immediately felt lighter and better about myself. 

I thought I'd share because all the advice I read on being ghosted was basically just, ghost back. For me, texting back was therapeutic.",Bumble,

Anxiety About Date Location,ds_aw,1625773746,"So I (25F) have been talking to a guy from Bumble (26M) for a few weeks now. We don't talk too much and haven't had any super in depth conversations, but he seems nice enough, funny enough, and we are in a similar field of work and school. 

He lives in a big city and I live in a suburb about an hour (with traffic) outside of the city. I told him I'd understand if he didn't want to pursue anything due to the distance and he said he didn't mind the inconvenience. We set up a date for this weekend in the city in his neighborhood and only recently have I started getting pretty severe anxiety about it. I'm getting anxious about the idea of driving into the city to an area I'm unfamiliar with, where there is only street / garage parking, so I won't have quick access to my car if anything goes awry. My friends and family won't be able to help easily if anything goes south on the date either. He hasn't given me any red flags about being creepy or weird, but you never know and as a woman there's always that thought in the back of your mind. I feel bad for questioning this so soon to the date, especially since I agreed to it, but I only recently started getting a bad feeling about it when thinking about being in an unfamiliar, ""far"" away location with a stranger getting drinks.

So would the best bet be to explain my anxiety surrounding the situation and seeing what he thinks and says about everything, or come up with an excuse to cancel and just cut our losses from there? I feel bad and silly about getting so worked up about this, but it's really just a safety concern as all other Bumble dates I had were more so local and at locations that I was at least somewhat familiar with.",Bumble,

Random Account Deletion?,mitchrapp80,1625767963,"I've been using Bumble for the last roughly two months and today when I attempted to open the app it took me to the login screen, I found that odd but I figured ok maybe the app reset..

So what does this mean? was my account locked/deleted? I can safely say beyond a shadow of a doubt I have never had a ""bad"" interaction on Bumble, so it's not as if I've been reported and Bumble has taken action on my account, since there would be absolutely no reason for any of that to occur.

"If you are a lonely man, online dating aint it buddy.",Depressedbadger97,1625710738,"So most lonely males have probably figured this out the hard way. That online dating just doesnt work for them, try and try. Wait and wait, new pics? maybe delete and start over? Nothings working. 

Ask for advice? maybe you want some advice from women on how to improve? ""women dont owe you advice!"" ohhh woops uhm..... 

""women dont owe you human decency! its all your fault your alone, women simply dont make mistakes!"" 

oh oh ok calm down, just wondering how.... 

""THERE IS NO HOW! WOMEN DONT WANT YOU! AND ITS YOUR FAULT!!!!!!!"" 

so whats going on here?? ""uhm have you tried improving your profile? hmmmmm?"" the woman asks, sarcastically automatically assuming you havent... ""does it list exciting hobbies that coincidentally benefit the women trying to date you? including but not limited to, investments, crypto currency, stocks, having private jets, and traveling over seas independently?"" 

meanwhile take a look at womens profiles, they ARE ALL THE SAME! just open up ur dating app and swipe right on a couple profiles, ""food, netflix"" OH WOW interesting women we have here! 

""not womens faults they can do the bare minimum and get dates, youre just not WORKING hard enough!"" they use the term ""working"" because working implies money and..... you get it now dont you? 

as a lonely man, it really is sad to say the only option is to simply give up. Women will comment when you say that and be like ""good, you should give up"" things like that, because its a collective intention of getting men they see as undesirable off the dating market. 

Now, of course women will say ""NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!"" but we can generalize, why? because it is 100% feasible that as a whole there is INTERESTS that benefit all of women kind when certain behaviors are benefiting ALL women, you can generalize.

I didn't opt for premium so I couldn't see who they were, but earlier tonight I was swiping through and ended up getting two matches. I immediately went and checked their profiles after each match and was feeling pretty good (lol). Then, I exited the app and after an hour or so, I logged back on to check the profiles again (kind of just out of boredom while watching tv but also because I forgot what their profiles were like). 

I checked their profiles from the Conversations tab, and for both, I clicked on their face from the convos tab, and it led me to a blank message thread, and then when I backed out, the match disappeared. That just means they probably unmatched me, right? It's nbd, but I just wanted to ask to make sure that was the case and it wasn't something I did. Thanks in advance!",Bumble,

Am I overthinking my match's reaction?,wanderwoman09,1625511488,"I matched with this guy a few days ago. I started the conversation, and things were going well. He mentioned how he had just moved to my city a few months ago, so I asked him if he had his own place or if he was living with roommates. His response was:

""Roommates? I'm 31. Where did this question even come from?""

That was an immediate turnoff for me because I saw it as an innocent question, and life is expensive so I wouldn't judge anyone for trying to cut costs. I have a career, but I still live with my parents while I try to save.

When I explained to him why I asked, his response was ""oh ok, gotcha."" But things just didn't feel right after that, and I am no longer interested in continuing the convo or meeting up with him, which I let him know.

Serious dislike for single moms...,consideratefrog,1625505909,"Hi all! I‚Äôm looking maybe just for some pointers or perspectives from men (and women, fuck it) on this.

Ive read a lot about what opinions there are of single moms on these platforms. A lot of concerns that I see are 1) child will come first no matter what to the point of neglecting the partner 2) women looking for a father for their kids 3) men feeling uncomfortable with the presence of another man in their lives 

I‚Äôm kind of in a situation where after a 5 year relationship (almost 4 years of marriage) I had been pretty isolated from friends and now no longer have a friend group to meet people IRL, really. I don‚Äôt plan on hopping on bumble or tinder or anything for at least a year, but have been thinking about the future moving forward a lot. 

I guess from my perspective, ive never seen the whole ‚Äúputting kid first‚Äù thing to be an issue because I‚Äôve never had a situation where I need to choose between my child or someone else. I generally don‚Äôt schedule any time to see people or hang out on days I have my kid, and if I do, I put him in daycare so I can have a day. I‚Äôm not looking for a father for my children... they have one, and it‚Äôs a positive coparenting relationship with no ‚Äúbaby daddy drama‚Äù that would interfere with anything, and him&amp;I only talk about the spawn and only see each other for pick up and drop off of spawn. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to deal with someone else‚Äôs kids should be forced to do so. People absolutely have the right to not want to date someone with children, and I‚Äôve got no issue with that. Prior to having children myself, I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to date a single parent either. 

So my question is: for those who *are* willing to date parents, what types of things do you look for in a prospective partner who‚Äôs also a parent that communicates to you that the child(ren) won‚Äôt be problematic for you? What are ways I can communicate the fact that i know and accept my children are 110% my responsibility and I‚Äôm not trying to push that onto prospective partners, without seeming like a ‚Äúpick me‚Äù kinda bitch? What are red and green flags you look for when it comes to a single parent? 

The last time I was in the dating scene, I was like 20 and had no kids and no real life experience with anything. So this is kinda... new. For me. 

TIA!",Bumble,

‚ÄúMaybe that would be good for you right now‚Äù,substantial-freud,1625500809,"So I matched with a very pretty girl and we talked on the phone a few times.  My best friend saw her profile and observed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a guy.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt see it.  OK, she maybe has a strong jaw for a woman, but other than that, the looks perfectly feminine, and nothing about her voice or conversation seemed male.

So I am over at my mother‚Äôs house for lunch the next day, and I am sort of brooding over this.  I have a theory that women are better at spotting men (ever since watching *The Crying Game* with my wife, who did not understand the point of the movie because Jay Davidson was so obviously a man), so I figure I‚Äôll show her the picture without prompting, see what she says.

What she says, is ‚ÄúUh... uh...‚Äù and starts laughing.

I put the phone away.  ‚ÄúYeah, that is what Dale said too.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn the other hand,‚Äú she reflected,  ‚ÄúMaybe that would be good for you right now.‚Äù

Now, my mom is open-minded for a woman in her mid-80s, but that is *very* open-minded.  Plus, I cannot imagine what about ‚Äúright now‚Äù or about me would make a fling with a guy off the Internet a particularly good thing for me right now.

Communicating while on vacation,Realityflair,1625500501,"I‚Äôve been on Bumble for almost two months. Finally met a really nice guy and we‚Äôve been talking for a while. We talked by phone and text on and off throughout the day and at night. We‚Äôve met up for dinner and hung out and everything seems great. He left for a weeklong vacation to Florida with family on Friday. Friday morning is the last time he sent me a text. I‚Äôm not trying to be the overthinking, crazy person as some women are labeled. However we were fine up until his trip and he made comments such as he was going to be sending me pics from the pool and picking on me as I have to work all week and will definitely be texting. 

I didn‚Äôt hear anything from him when his plane landed so I just assumed he got there and on Saturday I sent him a text saying hey I hope you are having a great time. I didn‚Äôt hear anything from him when his plane landed so I just assumed he got there and on Saturday I sent him a text saying hey I hope you are having a great time and I still haven‚Äôt heard back.

I am not trying to sound like I need to be in constant contact with him or vice versa but wouldn‚Äôt you think he‚Äôd at least text esp since he pointed out that he would?

Just got scammed,substantial-freud,1625496826,"Feels bad, man.

I guess all the warning signs were there:

* she deleted her Bumble account as soon we were talking by SMS
* she was way too affectionate way too fast
* she didn‚Äôt want to talk on the phone, only text
* her written English was non-native (Slavic, I would guess, by her trouble with plurals and articles) but in the video she sent me, she had an American accent

In defense of my intelligence, I will say, it was a skillfully done scam:

* she had a variety of photos of ‚Äúherself‚Äù, and used them appropriately to the situation
* she spent a *lot* of time on me before even trying to set the hook
* she picked a *very specific* job (broker for home solar installation ‚Äî I wonder if that was a set-up for a later part of the scam, or if the scammer had really worked in that industry)

Ok... maybe this is why I don't get any matches???,Galen74,1625457010,"First off, let me apologize since I know this subject has been addressed here.  But, I just want to make sure I am understanding this correctly.  I have been a paid male member of Bumble since March.  So far, my matches have been few and far between, and rarely do I even get anyone in my Bee Line.  After discussing the issue with some folks, I was advised to take a look at my settings filters, which are pretty much wide open.  I currently have my age range capped at 46 on the upper end.  I am 47.  Just for fun I bumped it up 10 years.  And, low and behold, a bunch of women in their early 50s pop up into my Bee Line.  I throttle the age filter back, and they disappeared.  Push it back up, and they are there.

So, now I understand that through my filter selections, I am not just filtering who I see new when ""meeting new people.""  But, also who appears in my Bee Line that have swiped right on me.  I assume this same functionality applies to other filters, such as distance?  If that is the case... then if I am seeking women out 99 miles away, and swiping right on them; unless they have their distance filter set to match mine, they won't see me in their Bee Line and have no idea I swiped right?  In other words, if they only want to meet men 20 miles away or less, I will not show up to them because I am 60 miles away.  Is this thought process correct?

If so, then Bumble is 100% useless to me.  As I have mentioned in other posts here, I live in a small town.  I am lucky to see a dozen or so profiles within a dozen miles of me.  The next two fairly sizable cities are 50+ miles away, then the next several are nearly 100 miles away.  From conversations I have had with women in these areas, they are looking for men within 20 miles.  This leaves me out.   20 miles from me are cornfields and the side of a mountain.",Bumble,

Hypergamia in Bumble,Azucena_Lifecoach_27,1625417658,"You see how the hyoergamia theory says we ladies pick the ones who look rich and handsome over the ones who doesn‚Äôt.

Also, I have swiped right some handsome men and they immediately are inviting me over for a barbecue or Netflix and chill to their home. Are there really girls who go to a stranger house just like that? 
So the hyper gamia says 90% of females pick only 10% of men, so that top 10% of men are getting 90% of women‚Äôs attention. Men and women are labeled by numbers from 1 to 10 based on looks and wealth. So if you swipe right 10 handsome men looking wealthy, the ones who show a boat, traveling, dress fancy, etc you need to be aware they get tons of messages each day. 
If you swipe right a guy who is not as handsome and not as rich, he may get one swipe right once a week and on his mind he is thinking maybe you are the one. Just to realize you will not choose him because he also needs to have his game on. Like great conversation, have a job, etc, and he will be walking on eggshells. 
So for ladies I suggest  try picking the ones who are not top ten, and choose an average looking guy, and take your time to know him.",Bumble,

When the time came to have the call, I called twice but she didn‚Äôt pick up. We‚Äôre still matched but I‚Äôm writing that one off as a goner.

Now, I‚Äôm sure she had better options and I don‚Äôt take it hard. However, for learning purposes I‚Äôm wondering if I could have done anything differently to elevate my position on her list. Was I too passive?  Should I have ‚Äúfought harder‚Äù somehow?  I was trying to be gentle in my silence breakers, and I know being a prick is a huge no-no, but would being wittier and less vanilla have made a big difference?  Since we did eventually pin down a call time I figured I would defer banter/content to then so I did not chat leading up to the call. Was this a mistake?

I always thought honesty was a good policy and being transparent about your qualities from the get-go is essential, but if it stops people from wanting to even talk to me, what‚Äôs the point?

I am autistic, not a vegetable. I have a great job that pays well for my age, I pay for my own place, I‚Äôm strong enough to lift a lady named Karen off the floor of a Costco and throw her in the dumpster like a heap of dry bologna and I‚Äôm taller than average.

Does lying violate the terms of service of Bumble or any other app?,SorryKaleidoscope,1625063323,"When reading reddit relationship shitshow stories one of the common patterns is *""after X months I discovered their profile was all lies!*"" and one of the common responses is *""report their profile!""*

But do they actually ban users for lying?  And if so, is all lying the same?  Are falsifiable lies like age worse than mostly unfalsifiable lies like ""enjoys hiking""?  Are profile lies, in-app chat lies, and off-app lies all equal?

I can't imagine Bumble (or any other app for that matter) wanting to admit that lying is ok, but at the same time, I can't imagine any app company actually wanting to get involved with sorting out which of its users are liars, or vouching for the truthfulness of user profiles.

I've also noticed that the official account only gets involved *here* when someone accuses another user of actual criminal activity, which lying, in general, is not.",Bumble,
One week of bumble and all crazy to max matches. Experience as a man on online dating,againstthe-grain,1625062275,"Match #1
She was pretty cute and we started talking for maybe a couple of hours on bumble. Now she‚Äôs not the only match I‚Äôm talking to. I talk to several women because I‚Äôm trying to find the perfect match for a date. I assume everyone does this? I mean why wouldn‚Äôt you, right? Well lo and behold, turns out I‚Äôm also talking to a friend of hers. She immediately informs me that I ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to her and I have to stop talking to all my matches ASAP. Of course, I was done with her right there. That was a red flag for me

Match #2
This one, to me, was the worst. Within hours of matching she began to send me videos of her didling herself. She wanted to meet up right away but I can‚Äôt during my work days. So we talked for a couple days. Then one day I became swamped at work. I‚Äôm talking 14 hours and no break! Couldn‚Äôt even touch my phone I was so busy. She proceeded to flip out in her mind. She posted to all of her social media that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too far out of your league for your ugly ass to treat me like this motherf*****. Good luck finding someone else like me‚Äù. Now I was never attracted to her. Her profile was misleading and filled with angles and filters. I saw her Facebook and how she really looked and I wasn‚Äôt attracted. However, I felt it would be too shallow of me to dismiss her because of her looks. I thought maybe she could be a potentially great woman. Well her little comment about me on multiple social media accounts sent up more red flags than China during a parade. I popped smoke and broke contact. That‚Äôs military for I got out of there real quick. 

Match #3
The same day we began talking, she started sending me screenshots between her and her ex husband. She constantly talked about how much she hated him and how she‚Äôs going for full custody because he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be a dad and bla bla bla. For the record, both a father and a mother are equally important to a child. A child deserves equal and unrestricted access to both parents. I feel for her children. Anyways her non stop bashing on her ex husband was my cue to bail

Does this experiment using Incognito Mode make sense?,aitaboy,1625061075,"I‚Äôm (40/M) new to Bumble (and OLD in general) but based on my understanding, I decided to take the following approach:

1. Subscribe to Premium (it‚Äôs worth the &lt;$20 to perform this experiment)
2. Fill out my profile (4 pics, all 3 prompts, bio, no Spotify or Instagram) and enter Incognito Mode
3. Spend a few hours selectively swiping right on at least 200 women who match my interests, the largest criteria being not wanting kids, or at least not saying they want kids. I do not want kids, but I leave it blank on mine to widen the net a little
4. wait 1 day and see if I get any matches back from this 200, who are the only people who can see my profile due to Incognito Mode

**The big assumption here is that when I swipe right in Incognito Mode, Bumble will deliver my profile to that person in some reasonable timeframe, and thus I will get a chance to be swiped on by those 200 people.**

The results were (of course) disappointing: 3 matches, one chat that didn‚Äôt go anywhere likely due to a pretty significant age/culture difference. I‚Äôm assuming the vast majority of the rest were indeed shown my profile, and they swiped left.

My conclusion is that OLD is not for me. I‚Äôd say I was reasonable in my right-swipes‚Ä¶I did not focus on Instagram model-types (if anything avoided them) and tried to be true to my interests. I was selective but I create a pool of at least 200, which should be a decent sample size. They were generally attractive, but reasonably in line with whom I have attracted in person.

I know I‚Äôm new to this, but I already feel like I‚Äôm out of my sincerity comfort zone trying to incorporate all kinds of advice about OLD profiles. I‚Äôve had some success meeting people in person (WAY better batting average than &lt;3 out of 200), it‚Äôs just slow and inefficient. I thought technology would make things more efficient, but it‚Äòs looking more and more like the swipe-world just creates a hurdle that is even more cumbersome for me to surmount than meeting people IRL.

Does my assessment make sense, or am I missing some aspect to this that I should keep pursuing?",Bumble,

Swiping Discipline - A new (partially substantiated) theory of how to get more matches,ProudInnsmouther,1625013956,"Hey folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I started using dating apps again last month, after the pandemic, with an entirely different attitude/approach to using them. I've gotten significantly more matches, and am getting dates (plural), with this approach than I ever got before. My theory is that it will help you a lot if you practice ""swiping discipline"", which basically means thinking critically about whether swiping on this person helps or hurts your overall chances of matching with someone worthwhile. Note that my advice is mostly for Bumble and Hinge since they operate similarly.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I've found helps get you higher in the 'stack', and more visible to people who actually will match back with you and want to message you:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do not swipe right on people who are clearly out of your league. The fantasy is nice, but there's basically zero chance they will both match with you and want to carry on a conversation/relationship with you when they are getting drowned with likes from everybody. You're just hurting your statistics for no real benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Do not swipe right on people who do not have a profile, or who have extremely basic, one word answers to everything. A profile like this signifies one or more things:

* That they are able to get matches easily and so therefore do not need to put effort into their bio (see logic behind 1) )
* That they are not actually all that interested in dating/dating seriously, and use the app more for validation/ego purposes
* That they have difficulty carrying on a conversation via text/are difficult to communicate with via text. This doesn't make them bad people per se, but it's hard to make a genuine connection leading to an in-person encounter when their responses are one or two words - something that's a lot more likely if their profile is barren

3) Do not swipe on people who put their instagram/snapchat addresses in their bios - it's not always true but these tend to be people who are not really on the app for romantic purposes

&amp;#x200B;

4) Be more discriminating in evaluating each profile - look for reasons why you \*don't\* want to swipe on them, rather than the other way round. If they aren't someone who's really caught your eye with a shared interest/sense of humor, and are just someone you think is acceptably attractive, there are a lot of criteria you could use to justify not swiping. Distance from you, lack of shared interests, age differential, blandness of their prompt responses, etc. You don't have to be super picky but keep in mind that these ""lesser"" criteria are also how discerning users (usually women) decide how to pick who to interact with - they have many more potential matches to comb through. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) DO swipe on people who you are iffy on physically, but who share many of your interests/have compatible bios. They are much more likely to swipe back, and even if you ultimately decide not to pursue them further, having made the match counts as a positive for you (and them!) in the algos. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of guys get caught up in trying to swipe as many people as possible, or trying to min-max their profile (you can see mine in my reddit history for comparisons). I don't claim to have a perfect solution or method here, but I think it's worth discussing things like this rather than getting caught up in recriminations against the app or women or oneself.",Bumble,

Now this is an old account that I just started using again, and I did used to have premium so could that be the issue? I'm not saying I expect droves of likes or anything, but it seems like SOMETHING is fucked up because I've had MUCH better luck before.",Bumble,

"Yes, its womens faults.",Depressedbadger97,1624996909,"I am tired of being told it isnt, and tired of being told to get over it. That women can ""treat me how they want"" and ""do what they want"" 

they use contradictions to shame me, and have 1000 methods of doing it. 

""no, you dont get laid because you THINK about sex, men who get sex dont think about sex"" 

""ok.... how do i never think about getting sex?"" 

""DID YOU JUST SAY *getting* SEX!!!!! you dont GET SEX!!!!!! NOBODY DOES!!!!!!"" meanwhile some guy is destroying this girl from behind. 

They claim sex is something that nobody should think about, but then I read books by women, for women, or at least from the perspective of women. Ive done this with a bunch of books, I like women authors. The thing is, it opens up my mind to how women think, things women will bullshit me on, and lie to me on in real life, and on reddit. When women communicate with each other, its a different story and turns out they ARENT all asexual like they say I should be. hmmmmm. 

So ive read the bell jar by sylvia plath, shes one of my favorite authors. The main character judges men harshly, but when you hear things that are romantic, its really heart warming... I didnt think women could feel affection or feel desire until I read this book. 

Why? why did I think women couldnt feel those things? Because women told me they DONT. Women told me I have to be asexual to attract women, because being attracted to women is ""wrong"" 

The main character literally has hook up sex with  a stranger while shes on leave from a mental asylum. ""WOMEN HATE SEX!!!!! WOMEN NEVER THINK ABOUT SEX!!!!"" has hook up sex..... yeah ok. 

Ive had bumble for nearly a year now and women absolutely treat me like garbage on it, same with other dating sites, the women claim I deserve it, I deserve to suffer. So on so forth, that im suffering because of my personality, when they played a part in developing who I am. 

I read the unwomanly face of war, a book written by a woman who interviews other women, so no male influence here at all, and the women literally risked their livelihoods to be with men at times. Would talk about how handsome some men were compared to others.... and im shamed for saying I think a girls cute? REALLY!? 

Im reading the hand maids tale, im sure youve heard of it, in it she literally fantasizes about men undressing her.... she fantasizes about these men being FUCKING HORNY! and masturbating against a wall!

I think the guy I was talking to lied about his father passing away (oh and he ghosted me too!),liferollson520,1624996550,"I (26f) was talking/seeing this guy (24m) I met on bumble. We matched in April and he took me out to dinner. He seemed to be normal, very hard working and family oriented. He had told me prior to meeting that his dad (who he was very close to) was in the hospital from falling down the stairs and rupturing a few discs in his back. He told me he‚Äôs also been taking care of his little brother (who he‚Äôs also very close to) who‚Äôs 10 years old while his dads in the hospital. His stepmom (married to his father) apparently went ghost/MIA on the father and her 10 year old son because her parents were also sick and dying in the hospital. He told me he‚Äôd be his fathers main caregiver after his father gets out of the hospital as his fathers in rough shape. He also told me that he‚Äôd be taking on his fathers medical bills as his father was in a sticky situation with his work and had little to no health insurance.
 
A few weeks after our first date (we also hung out one more time after our first date), his father got released from the hospital. We made plans to get a hotel and stay overnight for the weekend. He told me he‚Äôd get a babysitter for his brother. Well, that Saturday rolls around and I haven‚Äôt really heard from him and so I send him a text confirming our plans and he had told me his father had passed away after just coming home from a few days prior. I send my condolences and give him his space as I can‚Äôt imagine what he‚Äôs going through.

He calls me at 3AM, the day his father passed. He was drinking and said he‚Äôs had a crazy day with his dad passing and everything and just wanted a normal conversation. He was drinking and driving and I told him he shouldn‚Äôt be doing that and I offered for him to stay over my house rather than drinking and driving around aimlessly. So he comes over around 4am and stayed over till the next day.

In between him taking care of his little brother and his father passing away, he tells me he‚Äôs moving into a new apartment to be closer to his work on top of making funeral arrangements (which he claims he‚Äôs paying for). One day he FaceTimed me and told me that he was house sitting his sisters apartment because she went to Florida. My first question to him was: why is your sister going to Florida when both of your father just passed away? And he said ‚Äúidk I guess it‚Äôs her way of coping.‚Äù Seemed odd to me but I didn‚Äôt question the rest of it.

What also seemed weird to me was that he told me he was moving into his new apartment the day of his fathers funeral. Like how do you have the time to move into a new spot and attend a funeral? He also said his sister (because she went to Florida) and step mother did not attend his fathers funeral which seems wild to me. The day of his fathers funeral, he calls me around 9pm, tells me he‚Äôs still packing up some stuff for his new apartment. He asked if he could sleep over that night at my house, I told him sure.

A week or so goes by, we‚Äôre still regularly FaceTiming but then I noticed he wasn‚Äôt texting me as much. I send him a message telling him ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre doing ok and I‚Äôm thinking of you‚Äù and he apologizes for being MIA as this past month has been hectic but he still misses me though. I let it be, I don‚Äôt hear from him for a week but he posted on Snapchat. So I send him last text saying ‚Äúhi, just thinking of you, I know things have been hectic for you etc‚Äù. And nothing, ghosted. 

What‚Äôs weird to me is that I don‚Äôt think his dad really died. There was no obituary online or in the newspaper. His own sister didn‚Äôt attend her fathers funeral. Why did he move into a brand new apartment the day of his fathers funeral‚Ä¶who has time to do all of that in one day? Oh and I looked up his fathers LinkedIn and he is still active on it, liking different peoples posts. It‚Äôs ironic because his father has a pretty high up position at an insurance company‚Ä¶how does your father not have insurance to cover medical bills? Idk, seems kinda sketchy to me.",Bumble,

So a few days later she texts me ‚Äúgood morning! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not a liar like other guys‚Äù

She never sent a message the first time.  I did not extend, clock ran out. 

About 3 days later, she re-matches and sends a note: *""On vacation, will text when I return""*

I respond *""Have a nice trip""*, thinking she'll be ""busy"" past the 4th and beyond.  Just being non-commital and leaving a crack in the door.  I'm likely to un-match by the 10th, because I don't like loose ends.

"Are you there, Reddit? It's me, Anon.",RussianCatfish,1624919716,"Off to a great start. I arrived a few minutes early to my date only to find the place is closed on Monday. Somehow this happens half the time. I text her the news; she's only then getting off work. Gives me time to think at least. We decide fuck food, let's catch a movie. The theater reviews promise everyone will be talking over the movie, so we can chat without interrupting anyone. I'm halfway good at planning if not timing. She just hit me back that she's ready, and on the way. Then she tells me where she's driving from. I know the interstate between us is fucked, and it is easily a 40 minute drive on a good day. 

So I'm sitting here in my passenger seat to even my driver's tan into a farmer's tan, wishing I'd eaten before leaving. I expected to be eating a puffy taco by now. That's not entendre, they knew what they were doing when they named that dish though. I think the go-to feeling should be annoyance, but I mostly feel pressure.

"If you tell someone ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you‚Äù and then reject them for having a panic attack then you‚Äôre a sick, stupid fuck who‚Äôs bitch made.",Aggravating_Ad3015,1624881867,"Especially when they already told you that they were in a bad place physically and under a lot of stress literally when you first started talking. 

I simply texted a guy I was starting to see that, in addition to having randomly thrown up on an empty stomach that morning, that I was starting to feel like I was having a panic attack and was taking myself to the ER. Figure that anxiety is common enough that most people know that an anxiety attack isn‚Äôt the end of the world. I wasn‚Äôt suicidal or felt like self-harming. It simply felt like I was trying to climb a wall and couldn‚Äôt even muster the strength to lift my arms over my head because I lost all motivation to do anything but heart would not stop pounding. 

Didn‚Äôt call him crying while he was at work, didn‚Äôt ask him to get me. 

I just took my ass to the hospital and got my shit sorted. Normally I could talk myself down from oncoming panic attacks but this was too much. It was agonizing making the decision to ask for help by even just going to the ER. 

My boss and coworkers understood. My teachers understood. 

But evidently this was ‚Äúgetting too emotional‚Äù for a dude who literally said the day prior when I was complaining about not having eaten or slept well for 3 days that he was here for me. It‚Äôs almost like a non-existent appetite and an over-active brain fucks you up from all angles or something‚Ä¶.

I truly believe that a stranger would‚Äôve acted with more decency if they were actually witnessing someone having a panic attack, as opposed to just literally hearing about it second hand and not actually being expected to do anything like in this case. 

But honestly, I‚Äôm minded to think that part of the anxiety was hyper-vigilance kicked into over-drive since homie turned out to be a toxic piece of shit. He kept bringing up how uncomfortable his gay friend (he absolutely had to emphasize that his friend was gay whenever referenced‚Ä¶.) made him with his advances yet also copped to inviting the attention. 

Seemed like one of those people who tells on themselves pretty easily because they don‚Äôt understand the implications of the shit they say, or just what words mean in general.

Stop swiping right on profiles if they have dealbreakers listed,daisystar,1624815444,"This keeps happening to me and it‚Äôs frustrating. Something I love about bumble is that I can list a lot of things about myself in my profile. Then I can see on other peoples profiles if we have common values. For example, do we both want children, share the same religious beliefs, political beliefs, etc.
However, not everybody uses these features.

But I‚Äôm a bit frustrated that people will see things listed, know it‚Äôs a dealbreaker for them, and match with me anyhow.
For example, I don‚Äôt want to date somebody with children so I always swipe left on people who have it listed in their profile. This saves us both time. Please do the same for me, especially if you aren‚Äôt going to fill out your bio enough for me to know what your values are.

I know I can‚Äôt be alone in this. But dating is frustrating enough as is, if there is something on my profile you don‚Äôt like just swipe left. I don‚Äôt even understand why they‚Äôre swiping right in the first place if they‚Äôre just going to tell me a few days later that there are ‚Äútoo many dealbreakers for this to work.‚Äù (The dealbreakers being things listed on my profile.)

It's not that I don't like him, it's just that I'd rather stop breathing than go on a date with someone I've never met, especially when it could go terribly and then I'd have wasted a day off by spending 2 hours or more outside my house (not to mention the bus journey. I despise buses).

Am I just displaying the typical signs of pre-date nerves or should I cancel? It doesn't exactly help that I have 2 very busy weeks if work ahead of me and that's all I'm thinking about rn, so I'd really like to make the most of my free time while I can, and spending a day with someone I don't know requires a lot of mental energy I don't think I have.

I feel like it would be shitty to cancel now, at 11pm the night before, but we haven't even agreed on a time and the fact that he hasn't messaged me all day makes me feel a bit better about the idea of just saying ""oopsie no bueno looks like tomorrow won't work for me""

So I know I should have done better research before buying it so I guess it is my fault.

It‚Äôs always something cheap/free and low-pressure like meeting in a park or grabbing coffee/tea.

Is there a sub-culture, if you will, of women who ONLY contact people if they see those details only a subbed account is privy to filling details for? Am I basically dodging bullets with what could technically be perceived as predatory women who are looking for men with money to burn?

On top of that, there's no 'read' receipts as far as I can tell? Well, as someone who at least has a general understanding that despite the fairer sex having the priority of control, one would imagine that they likely still have opened up talks with enough multiple people to be a little swamped so maybe those who have initiated a 'howdy-do' with me simply put that out there and possibly just never got back to me when there's so many others that have piqued their interest.

I put my best foot forward have no expectations of reciprocation (spelling?) but feel lost when I genuinely have no idea if what I've responded with was even looked at. I don't mind the 'swipe' culture because boredom and instant gratification has been the name of the game for YEARS when it comes to online dating. I just want to have some kind of direction to better understand what I should do and not make random assumptions which benefits nobody.

Finally, every couple days, I either get an email or a notification bar from the app itself that implies there's activity but the gist of it almost always boils down to 'pay to be seen more'. Well, when I've swiped less than 3 dozen women within a VERY generous range of age and distance (I'm 32 and have gone 27 to 50, distance within 80 kilometres), am I supposed to read the room as there's just no one in the area using the app besides mostly men or is the app just throttling me trying to hold me hostage until I pony up?

I'm sure I'm missing a lot of minor details I've noticed but these have been all the major concerns thus far and I just want to be sure I actually 'get' what's happening. For my personal situation: ......uninstall? 

I don't mind waiting for more of the COVID fear to die down as more people get vaccinated (I'm booked to get my first shot soon) so that I can be struck down directly to my face but the options have always been slim. Other apps (a certain flammable one in particular) have authoritarian algorithms which automatically banned accounts which were NOT sexual, violent, or portray any kind of illegal activity in any way nor did I misrepresent myself or use copyrighted materials.

Is the presumption that there are guys out there who, upon getting a match, wait with bated breath for the stars to align with that person and don't swipe again until that happens?

I told him I‚Äôm not looking for anything serious but it seems like he‚Äôs romantically coming on strong... is this a red flag?,tunamutantninjaturtl,1624652057,"He‚Äôs not in my city at the moment but he‚Äôll be coming back in a few weeks. Right now he‚Äôs visiting his parents... we talked on the phone once already and he wants to talk 1 or 2 times a week. I don‚Äôt love talking on the phone because I feel like I don‚Äôt get a sense of the person unless we meet IRL, but I guess he doesn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äúforget‚Äù about him if it‚Äôs going to be weeks until we actually meet, and that‚Äôs why he wants to keep talking on the phone? The one phone conversation we‚Äôve had so far was kind of awkward, mostly because of me, as I‚Äôm not good at phone convos and kept accidentally interrupting him. I did find his questions to be very rapid fire and almost like a job interview, and they weren‚Äôt all easy questions either lol, some were more like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your most embarrassing moment‚Äù?

I told him I‚Äôm not looking for anything serious and he said that‚Äôs fine cause he‚Äôs leaving in a few months for grad school, but the phone calls and the way he always compliments me and tells me I‚Äôm adorable and sends me pictures of his day, are making me think he‚Äôs wanting that. He asked me to come up with things to tell his parents about why he keeps being on the phone for example. (In a joking way) I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôm reading too much into this. 

One consideration is that he‚Äôs not really my type, even in terms of personality ‚Äî I‚Äôm usually more into quiet guys and he‚Äôs very slick and extroverted and felt like one of those guys who are great at sales lol. And so I‚Äôm scared that if I‚Äôm not attracted to him when we eventually meet, I will have spent all this time leading him on by agreeing to phone calls, so I‚Äôll owe him something for spending all this time talking to me.

I (23F) hate being single,grac3form3,1624407971,"I got married pretty early in life and it ended at the end of last year. It was tough to be okay again but now I‚Äôm definitely over the relationship.

I joined bumble a couple months ago and I know I‚Äôm going to sound entitled, but it‚Äôs exhausting. I have no idea how to generate connections out of thin air with no context of the person. I never started a conversation with ‚Äúhey‚Äù and it‚Äôs always been an engaging and fun chat, but it‚Äôs rarely felt like a real connection.

I met someone who I kind of clicked with and we went on a few dates which helped make feelings real. The problem was, the feelings became real almost in a vacuum. There was just no solid foundation to our connection like a deep history. So without that solid foundation, as soon as an argument happened, we just never seemed to be able to recover. Those feelings are still there, but he broke things off.

So now I‚Äôm at a point where I could redownload bumble, have another couple dozen or hundred conversations and hope one works. But chances are I‚Äôll get my heart broken again.

I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm supposed to be single forever. I‚Äôm religious and believe in waiting for marriage and I feel like everyone my age or older with the same belief system is already married. I loved being married, I don‚Äôt know how to find happiness in being single.

I also don‚Äôt feel like I have time to be single, I want kids in my 20‚Äôs. I wanted to have a kid this year. Now if I meet someone today, date them for a year, get engaged for a year, be married for a few years before having kids. That puts me at 28 to even start having kids and nine months of pregnancy basically puts me at 29. 

I just want to feel loved and I can‚Äôt seem to get people to stay. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm the problem, I just don‚Äôt know how to move forward from here.",Bumble,

I think Bumble sucks,Emperors_Wrath83,1624390071,"It seems to me the primary function of Bumble now is to keep people single. Time and time again I hear of people with 10+ matches in their beeline swiping whenever they can and never matching with anyone. Of course there's no way to prove this but my theory is that Bumble is hiding these matches in order to coax people in to paying for premium. Now, of course the app is out to make money. That goes without saying; they're still a business at the end of the day. However when the app reaches a point of having little interest in actually matching people and is only interested in making money I think it's outlived its usefullness.   


I'd like to add that I first started using Bumble around the end of the Summer of 2020 and found a fair amount of success on it. However once January/February hit the matches completely died off. I tried adding to my age range, my location limit. Still nothing. I tried to follow advice on this subreddit. I fully filled out my profile. I ignored the app for two days before going back to it. Nothing. Those matches in the beeline never showed up.   


Any thoughts on this subject? I've also been using Tinder and found a much higher rate of success with matches there. On Bumble it feels like I'm in Profile Prison until I'm willing to pay bail and go premium.",Bumble,

I'm a 43 year old Maryland guy and I got scammed by a woman I met on Bumble. She stole from me and then later she tried to extort money from me.,PeterMainz,1624380348,"Long story short. I met her on Bumble. I dated her for 8 months. We dated casually for a while. Then I believed we were dating  exclusively for almost 4 months. That ended about a week ago. Early one morning I watched her take money from my wallet when she thought I was sleeping. I let her leave with the cash.  Later that day I broke up with her by text. I told her not to come back to my home. 

Within a few days of breaking up with her I learned that she had taken embarrassing video of me. In an anonymous email I was offered the chance to pay to prevent that content from being released to friends and family, colleagues, and anyone on the Internet. I've refused to pay. There are many many more details to this story. It's the most insane thing that has ever happened to me. 

I'm adding a pic below. I chose this pic carefully so that it wouldn't violate this person's right to privacy (funny I actually care about that, right?).

"Men, why are you all X?

&amp;#x200B;

So before you post ""pointing a finger at the opposite sex"" with a hastily generalization, it might be good to:

1. Wonder what the common denominator with all those behavior the opposite gender you encounter is, except the gender that is. (It start with ""Y"", continues with a ""o"" and end with a ""u"")
2. Check actual usage statistics and confirm if your hunch/bias is actually supported by stats. If not, connecting the dots between Y, o &amp; u might be a good start to see change.

I'm not blasting people that have honest question to the opposite sex, or want feedback and opinions about a situation/behavior. But there's just so many snarky posts trying to ""blame, point fingers, trying to lecture"" at the opposite sex, disguised as a question. (And this goes for both of the sexes)

I matched with my ex-sister-in-law‚Äôs ex-boyfriend. How do I initiate the conversation?,cronaaa,1624343157,"Okay, this was about 6 years ago (a lifetime in my mind). I (F/25) was dating my first ever boyfriend at the age of 19, I didn‚Äôt talk much with his sister even though she was only a year younger than me. It was only when I agreed to help her practice doing nails for her job that she warmed up to me and stopped hating me. I guess she didn‚Äôt care about me since she knew we wouldn‚Äôt last and she was right lmao. Anyway, she had this boyfriend, they were together the same amount of time (9 months) as my ex and I. I only saw him a few of times at family reunions or when he‚Äôd come over to visit her. I remember the day she broke up with him. My ex told me the gossip, they were on a date and he gave her a present and then she broke it off and he had to take her home after that. I saw her and she didn‚Äôt seem upset, she was only thinking about giving away the guinea pig he had given her months ago (I was a bit upset he had given it to her as a present, it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt agree with but he was 19 and in love and seemed genuinely like a sweet guy). Then, a couple weeks later, my ex ghosted me for days,  because he had been cheating on me, and he broke up with me via text. I was heartbroken and never saw him again. Though I did find out about a year ago that he stole a lot of money from the girl he left me for so I dodged a bullet there. 

So 6 years and 1 relationship later, I‚Äôve been on bumble for a while but nothing ever happens because I‚Äôm an introverted, socially anxious person. I still swipe because I‚Äôm bored or get lonely, so then I saw him. I recognized him but wasn‚Äôt sure. He has an unusual name though so it had to be him. I hesitated for a long time but swiped left. I regretted it immediately though. So after a few weeks later, hoping to see him again, there he was today. So I swiped right just to see. It was a match. Now I hate that I have to initiate the conversation. What do I say? ‚ÄúHey, do you even remember me? We both have horrible taste in people. Wanna go out?‚Äù Please help. 

Also, english isn‚Äôt my first language so I apologize for any errors.

My experience with Spotlight,PantryGnome,1624317527,"I bought 5 spotlights for $12.99. Each one gives 30 minutes (seriously?) of boosted visibility for your profile. I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be worth the money, but I wanted to experiment because I‚Äôve never used any premium features on dating apps.

I read that Thursday night and Sunday night between 8pm and 10pm are the times when dating apps are most active, so I made sure to try it on those days.  I typically average 1 like per day on Bumble. My results:

* Tuesday at 5:30pm - 4 likes during the boost. Followed by 4 likes later that night. The timing was an accident because I didn‚Äôt realize that the first Spotlight started as soon as you purchased it.
* Thursday at 8:15pm - Zero likes. Tried again at 9pm because Thursday is supposedly a high-traffic day.‚Ä¶ 2 likes. BUT I did receive 6 likes later in the night, and woke up to 3 more likes the next morning.
* Sunday at 8:45pm - 2 likes. Nothing else for the rest of the night.
* Wednesday at 8:50pm - 5 likes. Followed by 2 more likes later that night.

So overall I can‚Äôt deny that the spotlights did help, at least a little bit. In addition to the 30 minute boost, there seems to be a residual effect where receiving likes leads to more likes for a brief period. 

Ultimately, not worth the money for me. If you have a lot of disposable income though, you may as well pay to play.

Honestly I‚Äôd consider buying Bumble Premium if it included 3 spotlights per week instead of 1. It sucks that Bumble is so stingy with Spotlights even if you're willing to shell out cash for a multi-month plan.",Bumble,

I see a lot of negativity with online dating. Here is what I found useful,SpellBlaster,1624281297,"Aziz Ansari wrote Modern Romance which explains modern dating vs past generations. Through this, I found these useful dating app tips:

1. Make it easy to start a conversation!
   - have something in your profile that makes it easy for your match to ask about. This helps to begin engaging conversation and avoid a pointless ‚ÄúHey‚Äù to begin.

2. Do something together quickly!
    - one of the biggest reasons a conversation dies is from a loss of a spark. If you text too much before meeting up for a first date, the initial match spark dies with the conversation.  You need an in person interaction to form a relationship. 

3. Give it a chance!
    - there is a psychological tendency to want to wait for the next best thing when you believe there is an abundance of choices. What this means is if we have a solid match in front of us, we might want to resist committing to a date because there might be an even better match coming that we just haven‚Äôt seen yet. Give your current match a chance! Fight your tendencies, go on a date, and see if you genuinely like the other person.

tl;dr

1. Make it easy to start a conversation!
2. Do something together quickly!

bumble bff as a straight guy?,dontbelievejustwatch,1624254098,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this...

I moved to my current city (LA) last summer during pandemic. It's already hard (in my opinion) to meet new friends after college, let alone at 30/31. It was obviously even harder to do during covid. 

Now that covid is hopefully almost a thing of the past (the restrictions at least) and i'm vaccinated, i'm trying to do fun stuff or at the very least, find guys to play golf with, workout, go to bars, etc. i need strictly platonic male friends  doesn't matter their orientation.


I'm noticing many guys profiles on here have rainbows which is totally cool but i can tell from they're bios we prolly wouldn't have much in common, or some guys on BFF with vague profiles but then then the bio says  ""looking for friends or maybe friends with benefits""

Before I come off as someone who sounds homophobic, that couldn't be further from the truth. My brother is gay, I have gay friends, and as long as you're cool, I don't care how you choose to live your life. But i'm almost hesitant to meet up with some of these guys because i'm not looking to experiment or try or  anything like that... I'm literally looking for platonic male friends. And it's tough when you're talking to a guy who seems to be similar to you in terms of interests and stuff, and then he'll casually throw in porn/masturbating in the bumble convo- i don't talk to my guy friends of 20 years about that (except in a very obvious joking/funny manner once in a blue moon), let alone a stranger i met on an app 5 minutes ago.

Fast forward a few days, we're texting, and she tells me that she doesn't want to commit to anything, she just wants to date. When we had that conversation, I took it as she wanted to remain platonic. We had already made plans for yesterday at that point, and she came over at 4:30 and we made pasta, pizza, and some other things from scratch, then proceeded to watch a Netflix series and the first two episodes of Taskmaster S1. I had a great time, and it sounded like she did as well. Throughout this I was hesitant to try to make any moves based off our previous conversation and I didn't want to potentially jeopardize us even staying friends. I drove her home at around 1:45, and just before she got out I asked what she was really looking for if not a relationship. If I understood correctly she said that she wanted to be emotionally supportive, date, see what came of it, and if it was comfortable for her then go ahead with it.

 However I was texting with this girl for about 2 weeks and I feel like we had a lot to talk about. We had no date yet because of exams but we have spoken about how we will hang out eventually after she gets her exams done and stuff.
I wanted to text her again so I opened the chat with her and wanted to send her a photo of my TV with Doctor sleep playing since we were talking about it earlier today and that I'll watch it and let her know how I liked it.
However after sending that photo an error popped up and Bumble asked me if I wanted to try and send it again. It didn't work out however and after a while her profile was gone.

So the only reason I have some doubts is that her profile didn't disappear initially but rather after trying to send her a photo multiple times and that from what I've figured out, if someone unmatches you, you should still see their profile just greyed out yet I see nothing instead.
So did I just get unmatched or could it be something else?",Bumble,

Bumble corporate is failing it's users,BertBanana,1624029251,"*I get that this below isn't going to apply to folk who care enough to visit the subreddit of a dating app.*

I'm a dude and it's kinda laughable how the behavior is no different no matter what platform I use. I get alot of verified only matches, but it's the same half assed profiles.

""Be a good communicator."" ""Make me laugh"" like okay give me something to work with besides I am human, I am social. Track me down in all these group pics.

Thanks Bumble - I'm in an official relationship for the first time!,plooper59,1623950858,"Seeing a lot of success stories here lately so I thought I'd add my own (quick one) -

I've been on OLD platforms for several years, probably since Sophomore year in college, and for a while I found success on Tinder (casual), even more on Hinge (slightly more serious), and finally Bumble. To be perfectly honest, it was hard to find a good match on Bumble versus Tinder/Hinge and I went out on way more dates on the other platforms. But, my most recent match on Bumble and I decided to become official, which ended the exhaustion I was facing from dating multiple girls at a time with nothing really sticking (most flings last 2 weeks to 2 months). I've met dozens of girls in the past year and I'm so happy to be in a relationship in which we both want to be with each other exclusively!

I think Bumble has really progressive values and I think the space it has created is certainly the direction we are headed in the future. Even though my date opened up the conversation with a ""hi"" + an emoji, I felt pressure taken off of me to always be initiating the conversation. In my experience, a guy who tries to go ""tit-for-tat"" in initiation/effort is going to have a hard time, but Bumble definitely evens out the playing field and makes it more comfortable for both parties!

BTW, I did pay for Bumble Premium. A lot of people here complain that those quick matches dry up after their first couple weeks of signing up or after buying Premium. Bumble is not meant to be a place for quick matches. Every time I used the boost feature, I got anywhere between 1-3 solid choices, which to me is enough (can you really maintain 20 conversations? I can't. At one point I was managing 6 different conversations, some beyond the app, which was super stressful). I still have a couple weeks remaining on my plan, so now I use it for Bizz.

Anyway, just wanted to voice my support for everyone out there and spread good stories. I love Bumble!",Bumble,

A little background on me in hopes of giving a better understanding: Male seeking female. I am fortunate that I do very well on this app. Despite this, I am very picky about who I swipe right on. I am solely on this app to find a relationship and nothing more. I would say that for every 50 swipes - maybe 1 or 2 I swipe right on. I like to think I have a good sense if a match and I will connect but, of course, I have been wrong on occasions.

I most recently matched with a girl who stood out immediately from the others. She really was exactly what I am looking for. She very quickly sent out a ""Do not Disturb' gif as her first message. Slightly confused, I shot back with a funny/witty response which she also responded to fairly quickly, positively, and with a question. I then came back and then.... silence. I waited 36H, shot her another funny message and 36H later...nothing. I'm usually pretty confident guy but I admit, this one is tossing me for one (my own fault, of course) But does anybody have any advise, insight? I know I am not going to be liked by everyone!

"Hero on Hinge, Zero on Bumble.",Timid-Ibex,1623937626,"Hey everybody! I‚Äôm facing a sociological glitch in my online dating life that I can‚Äôt seem to figure out, but it seems like an interesting problem worth figuring out. (Disclaimer - I‚Äôm in India, so there may be some cultural differences, but having traveled in Europe and the US a fair bit, I think urban life and dating is fairly similar).

I‚Äôve been on hinge about 6 months, and I‚Äôve had GREAT success. I‚Äôve connected and chatted with some amazing women - some of them have become really good friends, and there has been enough romance to make me pretty happy. I haven‚Äôt been able to meet too many, because I actually live 8 hours away from New Delhi in a village and, well, covid. 

My match rate on Hinge is really good, at least for a newly single 40 year old. I think of all my right-swipes, 25 percent respond very positively. Of course, I see a SIGNIFICANT drop in matches when I generically hit like instead of sending a nice, genuine message, but I still get matches. 

(None of them have turned into anything romantically long term, but that‚Äôs on me and not the app. I have made great lifelong friends though. ) 

(For info - the Hinge match rating barely changes if I pay for hinge or not, I just pay for it because I like access to certain filters, like I know it‚Äôs never going to work out with me and a non-smoker) 

Having had this great, ego boosting success on hinge, and running out of potential matches. I downloaded hinge and paid for it. 

It‚Äôs been 3 months now - I have had 4 matches. Two of them I had brief conversations with, 2 I just waited for them to say something until they timed out. 

I tried changing strategies - lowered my swipe-left rate, re-wrote my profile a couple of times, changed picture, but no bueno. 

I could just stop paying for Bumble, and my live wouldn‚Äôt change a bit. But I‚Äôm just paying to try to understand why this is. Is it a technology UI factor, or is it that putting the onus on women significantly changes the dynamic? Or is it the difference in profiles? 

I would LOVE a woman‚Äôs perspective on this to help get to the bottom of this mystery. 

Here are both my profiles - because obviously this is just stabbing in the dark without looking at them.

Is the world telling me that approaching women is a better option?,Kingmusshy21,1623936873,"I have been using the same couple dating apps since I have been single. Bumble I always thought was ""supposed"" to be a little cooler or maybe more reliable since the girl had to message you. Either way I found the prettier girls on here compared to either hinge or tindr

I have actually had zero success with this app so far. I actually had maybe 3 matches since March and my profile looks normal and my pics are pretty decent and not too flashy.

I'm a 5-10"" dude who spends a lot of time at the gym and I couldn't be happier with the way I look as well as my life in general. I also spend a lot of time outside and always staying active and tan haha

I grew up talking to people my whole life so talking to strangers is something I do often either for fun or honestly for the hell of it. 

Now when I'm either out in public or at the gym I have no problem going up to random girls and starting a conversation. I always seem to think of something clever to stat a conversation. I never plan to say anything it just kind of happens.

I feel like it's nearly impossible  to show my energy/personality through online dating and clearly whoever is reading my texts are just going to decipher them in their own words so what I say and how I actually would say it are completely different.

Also maybe it's just God telling me to stop but the last two girls I took out on dates made it clear they have ""problems"" either emotional or just not happy (seems to be a big one) and I can tell they have not really found their way and these girls were 28 and 29!   
That's a big turn off for me because even being single I'm really happy with my life and what I do and just kind of waiting to share my life with someone else. 

I know using the app or apps increases your chances by probability but I'm starting to think the probability is lower and decreasing more and more by the day haha.",Bumble,

Just cancelled a second date with a woman I met on Bumble and feel relieved,GeezMoney,1623875276,"Yeah, I know not a big deal. But I thought I would like to share this as a catharsis. 

First, nothing wrong with this woman. She was great. We had a pleasant first date and some laughs. But because of scheduling, I was not able to set up a second date until three weeks later. Even though she was accommodating, I realised more and more that she wasn't the one for me.  It might have been a case of me thinking too much about it. But I also came to the conclusion that women I have really been into, I have never questioned going out with them again. But this time it felt different, like I was only keeping my date because I was supposed to. I think I am in a weird place and didn't want to drag her into it. 

We were supposed to meet up on Saturday night, but I cancelled four days out. I felt like I wanted to do this for a while but didn't have the guts to. I really hope she finds someone swell. She deserves it. It just wasn't mean to be me. 

I thought I would share this because often men and women think there is something wrong with them when someone flakes out or doesn't want to follow up on the first date. This isn't always the case. Sometimes the other person is just in a weird place that they wouldn't have seen coming if not for going on dates. That seems cruel, I guess.",Bumble,

Divorced? Yes, since December '20
Kids? 3 adult sons

Him:  Wow, do they live local?
Me:  Yes, all 3

He then asked me about the schools they attended, i told him 1 went to private school and the other two went public. 

He then asked about the $$$ I spent on the school.  Geezus, the graduated in 2004! 

Asked how I was able to pay for it? Lol, ridiculous. I said we managed, I work.

Him:  Your Ex live in town too?  Yes, we don't hate each other, we were married 30+ years

The video sound became sporadic, freezing, then disconnected. 

I waited 15 minutes for video chat back, then tried to call on the video chat. He declined the call. Lol! Then he unmatched me...rude! How Rude is that? 

What do think?

I'm thinking he's afraid of my 3 adult sons,  or he's a predator looking for an easy lay.

***Update-  I just remembered that he mentioned that he had a handyman replace an inside wall from wood to masonry! Yikes! That's freaky. I watch Lifetime movies, I think he was predator. At first, I was thinking hurricane season, but this was ""inside"" wall...then video cut out.",Bumble,

I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of guys in my age range seem to expect sex - which is fine, I‚Äôm not shaming anyone.

If you think this method of dating could work w an abstinent lifestyle, when would you suggest breaking this news to a guy? I don‚Äôt wanna lead anyone on or waste their time

What would cause Bumble support to ghost you?,kashmirage,1623778462,"Hi friends,

After years of being a happy Bumble user (lifetime premium), last week I realized I was banned, was pretty sure it‚Äôs a mistake so reached out to Bumble support, they said they can‚Äôt find an account associated with my info so I sent them the updated information but no response at all. Same thing with both FB support and email. It all feels like a nightmare.

I know I have not violated any rules and always treat everyone with respect. I had broke out of an emotionally abusive relationship not too long ago and now based on all of this I‚Äôm wondering if my ex is abusing the report system by making some baseless but serious accusations about me. 

Can someone who you haven‚Äôt matched with report you and that one report get you banned? What would it take for support to ignore your message altogether?

They haven‚Äôt told me anything so my mind is racing over different scenarios.

Is there anyone else I can reach out to to get help over this? Really frustrating and disheartening that you can get banned this easily and they don‚Äôt even care enough to respond. Really changing my whole perception of their culture. So much for kindness and empathy‚Ä¶ üòû",Bumble,

Her bio showed she was from an Eastern European city, and that she and her sister operate a startup in the city. Earlier this morning, I was sort of mindlessly swiping left and right and came across a girl who I thought was a bit out of my league, but thought, ""Why not?"" Again, to my surprise, we matched. Her bio also referenced a startup, and wouldn't you know it, she's from the same city.

I‚Äôve had a bit of a disaster,Intense_Anal_Lawyer,1623763895,"I was hoping people in this community could give me some advice, and some perspective. 

I matched with this girl on bumble, and almost immediately after we matched, she asked if we could move over to Snapchat. I agreed. I‚Äôve done that before, because some people prefer certain apps to others for communication. 

Well, we find each other on Snapchat, and almost immediately this girl asks me for sordid images of myself. I did not send them, but she kept insisting. 

She also told me that she ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt find‚Äù me on Instagram. I told her I didn‚Äôt have one. 

I never sent her what she wanted. I started getting nervous that she might be an extortionist, or a blackmailer. Keep in mind here, she knew my first and last name, but I still didn‚Äôt even know hers at this point, and she was asking me for all these compromising images. 

Well, I ask her what her last name is, and she gives me a name. I started googling her to try and confirm who she said she was. I‚Äôve had girls google me before, and I didn‚Äôt mind, not to mention she had already tried finding me on other platforms. 

Well, I find out she is real, and also that she didn‚Äôt give me her last name as I asked, but her middle name. I tell her I did this basic background check on her, and she gets really upset, saying it was the creepiest thing that ever happened to her, and how I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, and how I need to be more trusting of people on dating sites. 

I unfriended her not long after that, as things had broken down. Was I in the wrong for looking into her? I don‚Äôt think she has the right to be so upset at me for doing a basic google search into the stranger on the internet asking for sordid images of me. Everything I looked up was public information, but she wanted images of me that no one else in the world has, and could do serious damage to me if the world did see them.",Bumble,
He's engaged (?),ProblemWorldly,1623763152,"Last May, I matched with a guy on Bumble. After matching, we decided to move to texting because neither of us liked the chat feature of Bumble. 

We're not friends on social media but he gave me his number. I looked up his number and found his first and last name and stalked his socials before meeting up with him for the first time (I do this all the time so I know the person's not a catfish). Looked pretty okay/decent so I went about seeing him. 

I went on a couple of dates with him last May and enjoyed his company and liked him as a person. We made out a bit in our second date (fully clothed). 

Take note that we didn't exchange social media in the couple of times we met up. 

Yesterday, I looked at his Facebook again and couldn't find him for some reason. I logged on to my second profile and looked for him there -- lo and behold, he'd Facebook-stalked me as well and blocked my main account. 

The reason? He'd posted a pic with his arm around a girl wearing an engagement ring just last Sunday. 

Take note that when I'd first gone through his social media prior to meeting him, there was ZERO trace of him having a fiancee or even a girlfriend. He looked single AF. 

He hasn't reached out via text since blocking me and I have no desire to message him again. 

Not sure if he's just a lying, cheating sack of shit or if this was an ex he'd gotten back together with -- but I'm not holding my breath for an explanation.

Am I the only one that thinks putting photos of children on your profile is weird?,muffin-minge,1623756186,"If you have kids, I think it‚Äôs weird to be showing them (if they are minors) on a platform mainly meant for building romantic connections. Like nothing against people who have kids, but you can easily put that in your profile without showing their faces. 

If they‚Äôre your nieces/nephews/younger siblings/friend‚Äôs kids, that‚Äôs even worse. Now you‚Äôre putting someone else‚Äôs kid online for dozens and dozens of random strangers to see them. Most parents usually post their own children on private social media or on social media that they only have close friends and family on, I doubt they‚Äôd want their child being seen by a bunch of strangers. And there could be so many creeps on Bumble. 

Baby photos of yourself is a bit odd to me too. I‚Äôm just not exactly sure what people expect to gain from that. Like, if I‚Äôm looking through a guy‚Äôs profile, a baby photo isn‚Äôt going to make me inclined to swipe right. Like okay, you were a cute baby but you were also a baby.

I love being outdoors painting, stargazing, practising my photography and glamping. Anything that‚Äôs very comfortable and non-strenuous basically.

But beyond that, I don‚Äôt do much. I‚Äôve never learnt horse riding, surfing , tennis or skiing etc. I don‚Äôt play or watch team sports.

For some reason, all the men I end up on dates with are VERY athletic and adventurous.

Now idk if there's something wrong with me that this affects me so much but I felt really gutted. After months of nothingness, swiping through pictures like a buffoon. Finally finding someone to talk to and then it just ends like that after 5 messages. Really makes me feel worthless. 

So I start thinking I should delete the app because it's causing my to feel horrible. But then I realize that I have no alternatives and deleting the app will only make my chance to find someone even smaller. So I keep using it...

The data collected below is for the 5 months I've been on Bumble (since January of 2021). My search criteria is pretty simple. It's +- 5 of my age and 20 miles of my location.

For the generalization that women having an easier experience online, out of the 180 matches I've had, only 5 active convos remain.  I think the golden rules of online dating apply to both genders : ""Be attractive"" and ""Don't be unattractive"". I also think that age and race play a role too. Just food for thought. It's certainly not for the faint hearted out there!

We met on the Bumble in August 2020 and went out a couple of times, each date was amazing. Staying up until the early morning talking and laughing. She decided though, that since my kids were younger (13 &amp; 10, I have them every other week, hers are grown and gone) that it wasn't going to work out. I told her I understood and said I hoped to stay friends.

We stay in contact, and then one night, we're up late again texting. We go out a couple of more times, amazing dates again, and then her life gets upended, just a ton of personal crap hits her. I try to be there for her and supportive, but she pulls away, so I back off and tell her I'll give her space.

I get into a relationship over the winter that's nothing serious, more of a time killer than anything. I decide one day to just check in and see how life is going. We fall back into our same routine of long text conversations (and a couple of phone calls). She's had a long week and I tell her I'm going to take her out for a ""day of fun,"" she doesn't have to make any decisions, just be ready when I show up. I plan out an entire day and it just goes amazing.

Since then, if it's a week that I don't have my kids, we are inseparable, and then the weeks I do have my kids, we are in contact and find time to see each other. She has reconciled my family situation, is supportive of me being the best father I can, and is willing to integrate with my life. We have both said multiple times that it's the happiest we've ever been.

Just thought I'd post this to give everyone some hope! There's so many bad connections out there, and I've had my share, but if you are patient, lightning can strike and you realize what has been missing in your life. Looking back, when we met, even though we had intense chemistry, neither of us was ready or capable at the time to be in a serious relationship. However, patience and persistence pays off, if you feel that deep connection with someone, there may be some obstacles, but if you both communicate openly and honestly, it can work out.

One last thing, she's 51 and I'm 48. I realize most on here are younger, but no matter the age, there is someone out there for all of us, someone that makes you wake up every morning ready to take on the day, someone that is there to build you up when you need it, share in the good times and the bad. Don't settle for less.",Bumble,

What political affiliation should someone with less common beliefs use?,Silver_Exact,1623533469,"So I'm libertarian.  For those of you who don't know, it's like a conservative and a liberal had a kid who ignored the restrictions both sides would impose.  

Liberals want tons of social freedom (legalizing marijuana, keeping abortions legal, some want to lower the drinking age, gay marriage rights, etc), but they want relatively few financial freedoms, having high taxes and allowing the government to use the money as they see fit.  

Conservatives are the opposite, wanting relatively few social freedoms (gun rights being the exception) but tons of economic freedom (basically few government programs and consequently very low taxes).  

Libertarians want society to have as many social and economic freedoms as possible without it becoming total chaos.  The saying is 'My right to swing my fist ends at your face.'  For example, a libertarian would say you may drive as fast as you'd like as long as you're driving on an empty road and maybe don't have anyone dependent on you.  They want the smallest government possible without society going down the drain, a government that only does what the people cannot or will not do.  

So I'm not purely a liberal or a conservative because I don't agree with the restrictions that either side would impose.  I'm not a moderate because libertarianism is a pretty extreme viewpoint.  I'm certainly not apolitical, either.  Which option I should use?  Or should I just leave it blank if I don't actually fit into one?  Right now, I'm using moderate because it shows I care about politics but do not fit into conventional categories.",Bumble,

Web vs Phone Version Features,RNPC5000,1623413562,"Why is there such a large discrepancy between the web and phone version of bumble?

For instance I have Bumble Premium, there is no undo button on the web version. Like come on Bumble I paid for that feature, there is no reason why I shouldn't have access to that feature just because I am using my web browser. 

Another example is filters... we don't have the same filter options for whatever reason... like why is there no hard ""Deal Breaker"" toggle on in web version?

Also just a general suggestion, in filters give us the option to see no preference / left blank. This is useful for those of us who aren't looking for a particular hard answer for something.

Like for instance I am unsure whether I want kids or not, so I left it blank in my profile. I would love to see all the other people who left that question blank also, because it scares me when a profile says wants kids, or says doesn't want kids.

Or for instance I am politically a right leaning moderate, so I want to go see moderates, apolitical, and people who didn't answer the question first in my queue, then followed by conservatives, then lastly liberals. Makes it hard to find a lot of apolitical / moderate people who chose to not fill out the question as an indicator that they don't care about politics.

Lastly I don't get why Bumble like all other dating service doesn't have an exclude (aka not boolean) filter where you are okay with everything else but one or two groups. For instance if we wanted see everyone but one political group, we want to see everyone but one religion group, etc... it saves us time by letting us checkmark one thing only in the filter instead of having to checkmark a bunch of filters every time, and it indirectly lets us see people who leave certain questions blank on their profile.",Bumble,

I just came across a MEGA influencer‚Äôs profile when I opened the Bumble app,youcanupvote,1623353093,"I don‚Äôt know how to feel; for some reason I feel excited, at the same time I know that this feeling is just an illusion we get when we‚Äôre in close proximity with a celebrity (yes it‚Äôs on a screen). The profile is verified and this person does live not too far from my area. Seems legit and all the photos are nice and casual (not taken from the web nor did this person use Instagram photos). 

It‚Äôs nice to see that even being a multi multi millionaire, the profile is very normal and down to earth, not like the media personality portrayed online. And definitely not like those female influencer wannabes that have their Instagram photos and handle in the profile...

Leaving Restaurant Etiquette,redi20,1623348545,"This isn't the end of the world, but:

As a man, after finishing a meal and conversation, I want to escort my date from our table and through the restaurant, clearing the way and opening doors.

I know the layout (I made a mental note of the exits when entering) and the best way to get out.  Assuming dinner went well, I want to hold her hand while leading her outside.

The last thing I want is to emasculatingly and embarrassingly follow her through the restaurant while she stumbles to figure the way out, and I'm desperately trying to get around her to open the door first.

Just wait a dang moment and let me do my thing, PLEASE.

This post can be ignored by those uninterested in a man who is protective, providing, supportive and cherishing, or those who think this is too old fashioned.",Bumble,

Straight couples looking for a third PLEASE READ,tears_and_crumpits,1623345951,"Listen, I know y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have an ideal option for how to list yourselves and I assume you‚Äôre all going through the same thought process of ‚Äúwell girls do better on dating sites anyway, may as well list it as a woman‚Äôs profile and explain it in the bio.‚Äù

WOMEN DO BETTER WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THEM. STRAIGHT COUPLES TROJANING AS A WOMAN‚ÄôS PROFILE ARE A NUISANCE IN THIS COMMUNITY.

If you are serious about your search, be honest with yourself about the ACTUAL number of people who are interested in the VERY SPECIFIC THING you‚Äôre asking for, and list yourself under the man‚Äôs name with his pictures. Same song and dance from there.

People who are primarily attracted to women are more likely to be exclusively attracted to women, and bumble is without a doubt the BEST dating app for us. If you‚Äôre looking to set up a threesome or hook up with other couples, there is also a best dating app for you... it‚Äôs called okcupid. But if you insist on using bumble, please be considerate and respectful. When you fill your profile with pics of just a woman and use her name and the fact that you‚Äôre a couple is simply listed as an afterthought, only including an actual picture of the man at the very bottom IF that, it‚Äôs manipulative. There is no point in trying to game the system when your end goal is to meet real human beings in real life and have consensual sex. Be honest about who you are and what you want.

Straight women are WAY more open to experimenting with other women than lesbians are to experimenting with men. You will likely find more success in that arena, unless your boyfriend is ugly, and if that‚Äôs the case, then you must live with your choices. But as a woman whose sexuality is fluid and has mutually exclusive ‚Äúgay modes‚Äù and ‚Äústraight modes,‚Äù i have seen both sides and i can promise you that while a straight woman can curate a deck of just men, gay women never ever have the luxury of doing the same, no matter how many buttons and levers we push, thanks to straight women thinking they get a +1.

If y‚Äôall keep doing this, we‚Äôre going to have to meme you. I dub this skullduggery #trojaning. Please be heterosexual responsibly, this has been a PSA.

I explained later about how sex is a deal breaker for me and he said he understands and is willing to wait since he's trying to get more ""in touch"" with his religion (he's catholic) but I knew immediately this was not going to work out. He became dismissive and a little rude after. The next day, I texted him about the date and he said he'll be late cause he has to fix his car (which means we have to change plans), he then texted later that he can't make it cause he's sick. I immediately knew, this was his way of ending it. Now I have different matches on bumble but I'm contemplating just leaving it to expire.

I'm only 25. if i knew i was about to get in bed with an almost 40 year old i would never have matched with him. i feel so disgusted and used and ashamed that i didn't do my research beforehand. but you don't expect people to lie about their age like that. ive already reported him. i don't know if bumble can crack down on something like this because i can guarantee that he is searching for younger girls than me. I'm not going to say his name b/c i don't know if that would be breaking any rules.. but he is a doctor....a paediatrician actually, which is even more concerning. and he lives in Toronto Canada.",Bumble,

I've always had a basic membership, and it's been fine. Last weekend Bumble was down for a lot of people, so they gave me seven days of premium as a gesture of goodwill. Cool!

Errr... yeah, not so much. The novelty of being able to see 50+ people in the beeline was cool, though most of them were way outside my distance range. But what I really noticed is that my stack and subsequent matches came to a screeching halt. I flip through it every couple of days and usually have around 20 or 30 guys per day... I'll swipe right on a handful and typically match with a couple. So in any given week, I'll swipe through 100 men, match with maybe 10, chat with a few, make plans with one or two‚Ä¶ That sort of thing.

Bumbling Race: 100 men's profiles and a breakdown of their info.,OThinkingDungeons,1623159651,"Over Thinking Bumble

Imagine a race with 100 people where you're one of the competitors. Are you the fastest, smartest, best looking, most athletic, most talented, gifted, etc enough to beat all other 99 competitors to the finish line? What if we expand the number of competitors to 1.000, 10.000, 100.000 or more? What are the odds that you are the best and beat your peers to reach the finish line? Sadly this is 90% of the people on OnLine Dating (OLD) and few realise how difficult they are making things for themselves by being generic and swimming with the rest of the fish.

Instead imagine a situation where you're one of only 10 people in your race (or less)? Only ten people to beat, what are your chances of being victorious then? What if I told you that the top 3 or more leaders get selected? How much better do you think you'll do if you're only competing against 10 people or even less? What if you‚Äôre the only person running the race and the other people in your division haven‚Äôt turned up to start racing yet!?!

Why should you put more info in your profile? Imagine you‚Äôre checking applications for a job, people hand in resumes where they haven‚Äôt even bothered to fill out the paperwork, some of them half filled, some have actually done the work and made a point to fill it out correctly‚Ä¶ who are you going to ignore and who are you going to check? Additionally every little piece of info you give, further distinguishes yourself from the crowd.

The danger of many profiles I've seen (I'm not expert, just observant) is most are generic, to the point they do nothing to distinguish themselves from everyone else and thus forced to compete against everyone else. However once in a while, there are people who (I would argue) are smart and set themselves apart in such a way they become leaders in their niche. There's a saying ""find your niche, become rich"" or ""nich-es get bitch-es""

As part of my experiment I decided to borrow my lady friend's profile and generically sample 100 mens profiles through Bumble's swipe list with NO SEARCH FILTERS, I recorded some of their basic details and decided to see where the weight of 100 individuals laid their details.

Men‚Äôs Breakdown

**Initial Photos**

54% Verified their profiles, proving that their photos are in fact, their photos, which is nice when you want to make sure that the person is in fact the person in their photo and you're not being catfished

43% uploaded 3 images or less, 67% uploaded 3 images or more, showing off their lifestyles, their looks and increasing their chances of convincing people they‚Äôre actually who they say they are.

**Information on profiles**

So if your photos are good enough you might get someone to stop on your profile, but is there actually enough here to actually convince people, that you‚Äôre interesting? A match? Fun to be around or able to hold an interesting conversation? To earn a ‚Äúnone‚Äù the person hasn‚Äôt bothered to type a single letter in their profile, to earn a ‚Äúlimited‚Äù they filled in either their bio or a question, to earn a ‚Äúfull‚Äù I watched for people who filled in 2 sections bio/prompts in any combination or more. 27% couldn‚Äôt be arsed to type a single letter, 33% filled in their bio or answered one prompt, 40% actually filled a bio and a prompt (or more).

For reference I right swiped the BEST profiles, people who have good photos, filled out bios, provided interesting answers and convinced me they would be fun to hang around, out of the 100 profiles only 5 made it this far, the good profiles REALLY STOOD OUT, it was like seeing a sportscar car amongst all the beaten up trash vehicles.

**Random bits of info.**

30% mentioned they had a dog or had a dog photo, only 5% said they liked cats or had a cat photo.

The majority of star signs was surprisingly even, disproving my original confirmation bias that Aquarius and Scorpios dominated. Capricorns, Geminis, Leos, Taurus each had an 8% slice. Aries, Aquarius, Virgos made up 7% each. Libra, Pieces, Scorpios were 6% each. Cancer and Sagittarius were only 5% of the majority. 17% of men didn‚Äôt bother to include their star signs in their profile.

9% of men included their Instagram, showing off their (pretty cool) lives or work.

13% added their Spotify to show off their musical taste.

What does this mean at the end of the day?

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have data to necessarily confirm or deny that the people who filled out more or less info got more matches. Basic logic tells me people who are THAT good looking, who don‚Äôt need the additional help are far in between, instead the rest of us need to use every advantage we need.

Like I said unless you're so goddamn good looking that you don't need the help, you should really distinguish yourself, if you compete with the rest, you'll die with the rest.",Bumble,

Did I do the wrong thing by responding to a match whose profile I misread?,quantipede,1623132343,"Just now giving bumble another try, but I kinda dipped out on it a couple months back because I wasn‚Äôt paying quite enough attention to profiles and had swiped on somebody I thought was more or less perfect in every respect, and we matched.

However, whenever I match I like to just double check the person‚Äôs profile (occasionally I miss things or they change something in between matching and me finally getting around to viewing it), and I noticed upon my double checking that I‚Äôd somehow missed where they specified that they were only interested in poly relationships, which doesn‚Äôt work for me (nothing against them, it‚Äôs just not something I personally could be happy with).

I‚Äôm trying to make more friends, and we really did have more or less everything else in common, and I also hate when absolutely nothing happens from a match (I know, I know, it‚Äôs part of OLD and it happens, but it still annoys me), so I sent them a message explaining basically everything above, apologizing for having missed the info and that we unfortunately wouldn‚Äôt have been compatible but that I still wanted to be friends. I unfortunately don‚Äôt have the message I sent to post here; I got a notification that they replied, but by the time I got a chance to check the reply, they had unmatched. They were not the same gender as me, so no chance of finding them on BFF either (side note, I can‚Äôt believe BFF is still like that after all this time).

* I've tried different pics of myself, both selfish and professional.
* I've tried no descriptions, vague descriptions, in depth descriptions. The heart of the description has always stayed true to who I am.
* I've tried being selective with likes, I've been liberal with likes
* I've tried looking for casual, I've tried only looking for a relationship, I've tried being open for either.
* each change I use for at least a month, not changing my profile constantly 

I know I'm not ugly, and I know I'm not Idris elba or Dwayne Johnson or anything but it seems odd to me that I've never gotten more than one match in 1+ possible 2 years.

I know in real life the women who even remotely seem interested tend to want or have kids already.... but it's hard for me to believe that desired childlessness is that big of a turn off to women of all sorts.

And I know that I'm not trying to do anything long distance but its not like I live in the middle of nowhere.

I'm trying to think of alternatives to explain this lack of interest, aside from the typical ""girls dont match or message first"". Because I have similar experiences on other sites/apps as well.

Bad first date,theguy8432,1623045222,"
Met this girl off bumble who happened to be a friend of a friend as well. I was interested cuz she was pretty, was the same race as me(which is rare where I live), and enjoyed things that I also enjoyed, like raves.

Set up the date, and met up with her. Akward first hug but hey that‚Äôs okay we‚Äôll warm up with each other at some point.  WRONG. We meet at Starbucks so I get her a drink, she doesn‚Äôt even thank me for it, whatever we go sit outside. I was in for a treat.

The next two hours she talks about herself and only herself. How she got fucked up at this rave last week and hooked up with the dudes and kept saying how hot they were. I just smiled and nodded thinking when tf can I go home.

When she would pause to catch her breathe, I would interject something relating to what she was talking about but she quickly hushed me as she had an amazing story to finish. After 30 min of hearing her rave mdma hookup story I thought maybe it‚Äôs time to talk about each other. NOPE. Time to talk about how she made a Harry Potter inspired alcoholic drink for her friends.

I swear to god she didn‚Äôt ask me a single question the WHOLE time we talked. After two hours we walked to the trash can to throw away our drinks and she quickly walks to her car, I tell her it was nice talking to her and maybe I‚Äôll see her at the next rave cuz we both had tickets to it. I don‚Äôt know if I did anything wrong here, it was a very weird vibe and I‚Äôve never had a date go that bad before. Just had to rant, now I‚Äôm tired and have work in the morning rip.",Bumble,

How does everyone define the activity level categories?,anonyleen,1622916321,"‚ÄúNever,‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù and ‚ÄúActive‚Äù seem so vague to me!

I guess I vacillate between wanting to preserve ‚ÄúActive‚Äù for body builders/trainers/extended length backpackers/marathoners/triathletes- essentially people who are actively training and would consider themselves athletes VS seeing the active level as for people who workout consistently but aren‚Äôt as intensely focused on physical goals.

‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù feels strange especially when ‚Äúnever‚Äù is the only other option? Like if you do more than nothing you‚Äôre in the ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù category.

How do you guys personally define the categories for yourself?

I do 20 mins-1hr of yoga every day and have previously dabbled in hiit, weight lifting, and running programs. I‚Äôve never gotten to the point where I would consider myself close to an expert/advanced level- but I‚Äôve been able to extend myself and accomplish certain things I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do otherwise. For example: I‚Äôve gotten to the point with past programs where I can consistently be able to do sets of 8 pushups- or running 3 10 minute miles (as a female). Neither of those things is in ‚Äúathlete‚Äù territory but it required from me months of putting in the effort to get there. 

Anyways- what do you guys think. Is ‚ÄúActive‚Äù for my athletes? Or just making sure people are consistently getting active?

Does anyone label themselves as ‚Äúnever‚Äù?",Bumble,
Went on my first ever date. Don't think it went well. Is this normal?,TheCatSlut,1622915067,"I've just had a bit of a surreal date, and just thought I'd give you guys a bit of a funny story... and maybe get your thoughts.

I'm in my mid 20s and have had a bf before, but we met at work and never really like 'dated'. It just kind of happened. We broke up over lockdown (I'm still devastated but need to try to move on) so downloaded bumble. 

I matched with a guy, and we've had a pretty banterous back and forth while getting to know eachother over the past few weeks. You know, both making fun of eachother and not taking ourselves too seriously. It's been a lot of fun and we have a lot in common. So we agreed to meet. How bad can it be?

So we meet up. We then go into the restaurant and he says something that really really cut deep actually. He says 'you look uglier in real life'. I asked him to repeat it, kind of thinking I must have misheard, and he does... I was just kind of taken aback.

I was half tempted to leave but stuck through the meal. He made fun of quite a few things (my shoes, the school I went to, my backpack etc.) but there was nothing really complimentary. Like, I don't think he said a single thing that was nice. 

I kind of figured he was trying to be funny but wasn't into me, so made a quick getaway after the meal. He walks me to the train station, and kisses my cheek on the way. On the way, I could feel him maybe going to grab my hand but wasn't sure so put them in my pockets. I then go in for the 'goodbye hug' and he TRIES TO KISS ME ON THE LIPS as I pulled back from the hug! I just swerved him (very awkward as very public) and was like 'Ooh, haha, maybe not on the first date!'.

He then texts asking me how I found it. I did not mince my words and said it was like an hour and a half of a roasting session and couldn't believe the comments on my looks. He apologises, calls me twice, says he really likes me, thinks I'm cute and thinks I'm too good for him, and he was trying to be funny. He wants me to forgive him and see him again so he can redeem himself.

Am I just really really unlucky or is this how dating is? I think maybe he was nervous and was trying to be funny. But maybe this is a huge red flag. 

It just really cut to the core when he said about my looks, and now I feel really self-conscious. I don't have any filtered photos or anything, and I've just tried to show me as I am. I actually think I could take some better photos if I could really be bothered. Now I'm worried about future dates. :(",Bumble,

Does anyone on here feel they have never done any of the things that their gender often gets criticized for?,HandHoldingClub,1622904274,"There's so many tropes of people on dating sites that are usually gender specific. 

I know as a guy I have never:

1) Tried to hook up on a first meet up 

2) Asked to meet up, face time, or anything other than text chat on the first day of matching

3) Asked for suggestive pictures

4) Asked for a snapchat 

5) Held a fish

There's probably more but I don't need to list everything. I hear all the time that this is why online dating sucks, because men are just trying to hook up. I've never once tried to hook up, it's just not my style. 

It works both ways, people hate on tropes of things women do on apps as well!

Just to be clear I don't think I'm a perfect match just because I don't do the things listed above, or complaining about not matching. I suck for my own reasons tyvm.",Bumble,

Everybody's experience on dating is their own truth and reality and shouldn't be criticised,theunknowngame,1622901605,"I feel like a lot of people ( men especially ) are criticised for having different beliefs on the dating world because of their own experiences. Even if these men are wrong, they shouldn't be criticised at all for their beliefs ( except if they are very violent ) because that is their truth and their experiences and insulting them, calling them names and all that isn't going to change their mind. What will change their mind however will be new experiences  that will prove the opposite of what they have experiences. No amount of words or lecturing will change someone's mind unless they experience. 

So let us all accept each other for our own experiences, we don't have to agree with each other but we should respect each other even if their opinions don't match our beliefs.",Bumble,

Bumble success!!,user_5011,1622873832,"Never thought I‚Äôd actually be posting this, but I‚Äôm up late still starring at my lovely flower arrangement &amp; teddy bear to celebrate my 2 month anniversary (we both jokingly mentioned how people make insta posts on silly anniversaries like this, but he‚Äôs a hopeless romantic (&amp; I‚Äôm a little more of a jaded gal, but he‚Äôs melting my cold heart lol), which is why he sent something). Surprised it happened in the midst of a global pandemic considering I found myself in situationships/flings when the world wasn‚Äôt as crazy as it was/is. I tried everything (bumble, hinge, tinder), and was a habitual download &amp; delete person for roughly 3ish years. What helped me out was knowing explicitly what I wanted (relationship) &amp; not settling for people who wanted something casual. I always felt weird selecting relationship or saying that‚Äôs what I was looking for because it felt lowkey embarrassing &amp; just safer to say I don‚Äôt know yet, but I knew I wanted to be in a relationship with someone so why not be open about it. The thing is, you wanna narrow your options down, and filter out the bs. I use to always be concerned with having a wide variety. Another thing that really attracted me to my bf was that we didn‚Äôt go back &amp; forth via text for a long time before making plans to meet up. Within the 1st week since we matched, we made plans for dinner. I‚Äôve waited as long as 4 months to meet up with guys, and it‚Äôs just pointless/waste of time. With everything going on, I say at least do a FaceTime chat (if you‚Äôre feeling panicked about what to do, perfect date idea would be to play we‚Äôre not really strangers or an online escape room) or irl meet if y‚Äôall both feel comfortable within the first 2 weeks, or else move on. The vibes could be perfect texting, but in person it could suck. We texted enough that I felt pretty comfortable driving myself &amp; meeting him in a public restaurant. 

Bumble (&amp; other apps) can absolutely SUCK at times, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôve cried &amp; experienced so much heartbreak I feel like I deserve financial compensation tbh.

New to Bumble and finding it frustrating. Can't figure out what I'm doing wrong,Regulatori,1622862166,"I've always dated people meeting them face to face or being set up by a friend, so I'm kind of new to the app deal. 

I'm just finding Bumble incredibly frustrating. 

Example...
1. My phone (Android) gets a notification that I have a match or someone is waiting for me. 
2. I click the notification and sends me to a profile. 
3. I click the check to approve and most of the time nothing happens. 

Here is the frustrating part. A lot of my matches are the opposite of the type of person I'm looking for in my profile. I'll specifically talk about fitness, eating healthy, no interest in kids, etc.. Yet I'll get the complete opposite matches. 

But often time I do get a match, click to enter the app, see the profile and think ""About time! This woman actually shares all of my specific interests, same drive, goals, no kids, etc.."" And to be blunt, has a similar attraction level to my previous relationships. 

But every time I get that last option, nothing happens when I click the ""check."" It just moves to the next profile. 

I'm at the point where I want to throw my phone every time I finally get a worthwhile match and nothing happens. Or when I finally get a quality match, nothing happens.",Bumble,

Was my drink spiked? ( BUMBLE BFD STORY),raggarase,1622843915,"Male here. Started texting to this guy on Bumble BFF, no big deal. From word to word, he invites me to meet up with his 2 friends in a bar that was very close to my place, so I give it a go.

The guy was homosexual, I am straight.  I have no issues with gays/lesbians etc and dont really care about sexualities but there is a reason why I am mentioning this.

We go out to this dark bar, I meet up with his 2 friends. They were in their 30s, chill dudes.

We go on and the guy who invited me, offers to get us all beers. He goes to the bar and comes back with 4 open beer bottles. I didn‚Äôt think any of it and we said cheers, and started drinking and talking.

2 sips into the beer, I noticed I was getting a little dizzy, not like the regular feeling when you are drunk. It was more like I didn‚Äôt have too much power and my head was heavy. I then look around and see nobody is drinking from their drinks, it‚Äôs only me who sips.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it and continue to talk to them when and drink from the beer. In about 5 minutes I noticed that still nobody was drinking and I was getting tipsy from 10 sips. I can usually drink about 150ml of straight whiskey until I get to the point of being a little drunk.

Fast forward to half a bottle down, this guy starts joking how one time he spiked the drink of a girl while I am drinking from mine. I don‚Äôt know what it was but right when he said that, my head was so heavy to the point where I could barely stand. I stood up and felt like I swallowed a golf ball in my throat. 

I told them that I had to make a call outside and proceeded to put my jacket on, while doing so, I started seeing the people around me as silhouettes and everything was moving like I was about to fall on the floor. I quickly went out the bar and started walking home, while walking though I continued to see silhouettes of the people that were passing around me, then I realised I was walking into the completely wrong direction so I panicky turned away and continued walking. This feeling continued for the next 30 minutes and faded away.

I never felt this way after drinking any alcohol.

One day we were talking and she kind of let it slip that her boyfriend broke up a while back ago. So me wanting to make up for My mess up basically start talking to her seeing if she might be interested in going on a date she said she is and so by start to try to figure out a time to do that.

And then again she cancels saying that she's too stressed out and there were too many things going on and she just wanted a day to herself to relax and study. So now I'm realizing she's just needing me along or trying not to make me feel bad. So I tell her it's fine we can just be friends don't got to keep the jig up. She says it's totally fine if we be friends but still like to hang out. But doesn't ever message me.

Who should text first after the first date ?,claireflame,1622792942,"Hi everyone. 

So, yesterday I've been on a first date with a guy I had matched with on Bumble; we had been texting for about 10 days. 

I (28 F) was the one who suggested that we go on a date in the first place, and he seemed enthusiastic about the idea. I think the date went really well! Definitely the best one I had in a while and I felt like he liked it too. At the end of the date, the goodbye was a bit awkward (which I think it's quite normal sometimes) and he ended up hugging me. 

It's been 24hrs and I haven't heard anything from him. Normally I wouldn't mind being the first one to text, but this time around I felt like I've done a lot of ""first moves"" with him and I'd like to give him the chance of showing that he's interested as well. In nearly all the dates I've been on so far, the guy would text me at least the standard ""thank you"" message the same evening .. and that's what I thought was the norm. Should I take the fact that he hasn't texted me anything as a sign that he is not interested ? How much do you wait before texting someone after a date?

I feel like I'm overthinking this, but I just really liked the guy!

I redownloaded bumble because I wanted to see when my current boyfriend and I first matched and I found something absolutely mortifying.,LoudPainfulFarts,1622761291,"I dated my ex boyfriend (D) from April of 2019 - October of 2020.  Then I met my new boyfriend (T) on bumble this February.  The other day, T and I were reminiscing and we wanted to see our old chats so I redownloaded bumble and had to guess my log in information.  I did accurately guess my log in for bumble, but I guess correctly for an OLD account I forgot I had.  It was an account I made for Bumble BFF back in 2018 when I first moved to a new state.  I had matched with a total of 6 girls and ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE GIRLS MY EX D WOULD EVENTUALLY CHEAT ON ME WITH (it was also his ex girlfriend).  My brain cannot fathom the odds of this.  Out of the millions and millions of people in the area, I matched with her.  It was shocking.

"I hate the ""Looking for"" options and wonder if others feel the same.",djpharoh,1622756209,"TL;DR: None of the options in ""Looking for"" accurately fit my dating mind set and I'm wondering how others deal with that particular system.

As I think about the options available in the ""looking for"" section (don't know yet, something casual, relationship, marriage) I realize none of them will accurately express my dating intentions. Combine with the perception that ""don't know yet"" and ""something casual"" are mostly regarded as code for FWB or hooking up, I feel like any option I choose going to do me a disservice.

To provide some background into why I feel this way: I do not believe in marriage, and I approach life with a ""have no expectations and I won't be disappointed"" mindset. With that in mind, I would ideally want to date someone for 3-6 months  non-exclusively so I can make sure I want to pursue a serious relationship with said person. However, I am quickly learning that this goes against most societal norms. I see most people want to establish exclusivity within a couple of months, some within a month. That's scary to me since exclusivity is basically my equivalent of marriage. I need a longer non-exclusive period to protect myself and my interests. Which is why the options frustrate me a lot.

# Relationship

This may seem like the obvious choice given the above information, but it goes against my ""have no expectations"" mantra. Stating I want a relationship in my profile only to match with someone and explain I want to date non-exclusively for 3-6 months makes me very anxious. I feel like I'm scamming the other person. 

I also think using the relationship descriptor is counter productive. My immediate goal when meeting someone and starting the dating process is to enjoy spending time with that person as much as possibe. The best way I can ensure that is by staying as present as I possibly can, and basically date them with a complete disregard for the future of the relationship. They and I will enjoy today and we will think about tomorrow, tomorrow. In short I wish there was a descriptor to signal those that date with a similar mindset to my own.

# Something casual

Best case scenario I will match with others who only want to hook up or do a friends with benefits, which I don't want. Worst case it basically tells others to stay away from me, and I already barely get matches and swipes. 

# Don't know yet

This is what I feel is the best description of me, but if others are going to treat it like I want just sex but I'm too scared to be upfront about it I end up in the same purgatory as something casual.

# Marriage

Thankfully, I can simply eliminate this. I don't believe in marriage so I don't use this descriptor. I also filter out anyone who has this in their profile.

Does anyone else feel similar? If you were in my shoes how would you approach the problem?",Bumble,

I have this idealized idea of just being me and giving full thoughtful responses. That the right person will appreciate that and not see it as a sort of desperation or overshare. In the real world when I meet somebody new I treat them like an old friend. I give them my full personality spectrum.

So typically the lady will have a few lines with a few questions. She answers my questions minimally. While I have a wall of text painting a picture of whatever I'm explaining. I do in a way think I am trying to prove I'm interesting and worthwhile; which after the COVID dry spell; I suppose I'm a little latching on to what comes my way like it's scarce.

I suck at texting and usually try to get a phone call after a couple exchanges. On a call fleshed out conversation and stories become appreciated and it speaks to a personality.

I need to write something and post it on my bathroom mirror.
**BEFORE YOU RESPOND**
-Shorter responses - You're busy but can find some time to respond
-Surplus mindset - This isn't the only person you're talking to and there are plenty of people out there.
-You're valuable - Give her the chance to earn your attention, people appreciate things they earn.
-A wall of text is overwhelming

"Browse the competition, see what you're up against!",OThinkingDungeons,1622699549,"So I have my account which is currently Snoozed because I'm not aiming to date just yet, somehow in the few minutes(!) I had it up and I got a few matches and they all messaged me. Despite these seemingly good indicators I'm still improving my account but getting bored because improvements are small and difficult to gauge without feedback. While talking to one of the women who matched me, I asked her why she matched my profile and she shared it was because most of the profiles out there don't have any effort/information/photos/shared interests...

If it's not obvious there's a lot of competition out there, so what are some people doing that's successful and what are some doing that's killing their opportunities? My suggestion browse your competition and think to yourself ""would I swipe on this profile?""

I won't go into how to create an account because it's not rocket science, if you can create a Bumble account, you can create a temporary one. Alternatively, borrow your friend of the opposite sex's phone to browse, let them use your account so they can see what it's like on the opposite side. The two of you can exchange notes afterwards about what you've learnt.

First, let's address the ethical boundaries. If you never match with anyone and never start conversations with them, then nobody's expectations are being hurt (especially if your profile has no info), this is basically 90% of the interaction most people have on Bumble anyway. Second, you're only using this profile to browse, nothing more, do you feel guilty for looking through Ebay or any online shop? (because you shouldn't).

&amp;#x200B;

What are you looking at and for?

1. Swipe through accounts and think to yourself 
   1. What is my first impression?
   2. What messages do their photos send?
   3. Why is this person interesting? (Or why ISN'T this person interesting)
   4. Would I want to date this person (as the opposite sex)
   5. HOW has their profile helped you come up with your answers?
   6. What have you learnt from this profile, that you can apply to your own?
2. Delete your account when done

Hopefully, by doing this little bit of research you'll understand where you and your profile stands. In my case I didn't feel so bad about my height or my chances, but I also occasionally saw some sex bomb accounts, people who obviously know what they're doing (amazing photos, fascinating prompts). These accounts definitely inspired me to do better.

For men DO BETTER!, the minimal effort = minimal replies. For women, it's really all about your photos, don't scare men away with red flags in your prompts too.",Bumble,

I stopped hearing from him after he checked in on me at noon but didn‚Äôt double text or anything I assumed he was busy with work.

"""Have kids + want more"" to read or not to read?",sucramdoow,1622562915,"Hello

I've been talking to a girl I met on the app and in my profile it says ""have kids + want more"". We've met up once and we're constantly chatting everyday, with a plan to meet up again this week.

However, the topic of my child hasn't come up yet (we only met for 1hr and a half), and I'm more inclined to talk about my situation in person (for context im a part time dad, as my kid lives with the mother) so not really comfortable texting about it.

I'm having a bit of anxiety over whether or not she's read my small info bit and knows I have kids and is just too polite to bring it up. Now the pressure of it has built to a point where I'm worried she'll bail as soon as she knows I have a kid or make a scene (if it does happen, then so be it) as I've had a bad experience with it a few months ago.

Has anyone been in a situation where the person they are dating hasn't read your bio in full? Or any situation where you've got kids/they've got kids and the topic hasn't come up and you struggle to ""insert it"" into the conversation? What's the general etiquette of telling someone you're dating about your children?

So I send him a pic. He wants more, one with me smiling, so I send one and then a face that was like a grimace.

I come on this morning and guess dude didn‚Äôt like my face because the guy reported me for trying to buy/sell and now I‚Äôm blocked.

App Designed To Make Dating Safer Is Looking For Female Testers,linux_dealer,1622547187,"Hi,

I've developed app (web &amp; mobile) with the intention to make dating safer for women.

You can learn more about the app here [https://vimeo.com/557539423](https://vimeo.com/557539423)

And you can also see short demo of the mobile app (Android) here [https://vimeo.com/557296122](https://vimeo.com/557296122)

The app has been tested in development but it is now seeking group of female volunteers to test it and to provide much needed feedback.

In order for Google to allow you participate as a tester we need your email address.[https://forms.gle/pNvG33dX51w5apn16](https://forms.gle/pNvG33dX51w5apn16)

note:    All accounts created and men added to the app while testing will remain on the app only for 48 hours. Everything is deleted in 48 hours intervals. For security reasons.

The app is here to serve women and parents. If you decide to participate in this test you need to make sure that you allow your phone camera and storage to be accessed by the app in your phone's settings.

Thank you in advance for taking part and for any feedback you may have.

"This app is really, really flawed because of the timer",Justatossawayacount,1622460541,"So first off, I thought the concept behind this app was pretty progressive/forward thinking in that the women message first. It prevents an unsolicited duck photograph from being sent as the first message, and when a woman actually matched AND messages me first...it lets me know she may have actually taken the time to read my bio or is otherwise genuinely interested. I also really appreciate the fact that I can filter people out who don‚Äôt have or want kids since I‚Äôm pretty firm on being CF and antinatalist.

That being said, I think it‚Äôs a little predatory due to there being a 24 hour time limit once a match is made. We all have lives and many things can transpire in that time frame. If a message isn‚Äôt sent in that window...the connection could be gone forever. Having to throw money at this thing just to extend that timer is about as bad as microtransactions in (insert big budget video game here). I refuse to fall for it. I‚Äôm probably wrong or thinking too much about this, but it makes me wonder if whoever developed this thing secretly wanted those who weren‚Äôt loaded to feel inferior.

I didn't text her and I never heard a peep. She was sweet, but when she left I felt like it was too quick of a hug goodbye. I decided to put the ball in her court that way to see if she showed interest.

A little while later, i made a tinder and saw him there again, and this time, i decided to super like him - which, i've never super liked a guy before. We matched again on tinder but he didn't say anything ... i was being prideful and thought since i super liked him, he should've said something so i just decided to let it go and forget about him.

I eventually took a much needed break from the apps and deleted all my profiles bc i've been traveling and had a lot going on. About 2 weeks ago, after a few months away, I downloaded bumble and of course we matched, again. This time though, I sent a better first message and he actually replied and we had a few back and forth messages. He said he barely checks bumble and asked for my insta. I gave it to him...

It's been 5-6 days, my insta is private and i haven't received a request from him nor did i get another message on bumble. He did put his insta on his bumble profile, so i'm wondering if i should've just added him originally instead of sending him my profile and waiting for him to add me...idk?

I have other matches i'm interested in and am going on a first date with someone else this week, so there is a part of me that knows i should just let this go since this dude clearly doesn't care and isn't really trying as i'm pretty sure he's been on bumble since i last messaged him ... but if i'm being honest, out of all the hundreds of profiles i've seen, he's definitely the most attractive to me which is why it's kinda hard for me to forget about him lol.

I've never double messaged a guy before and am wondering if i should in this situation? And if i do, what do I say? Or, do I just go ahead and add him on insta since he he literally includes it in his bio? Or, do i just let it go? ty for your help!",Bumble,

Perspective for men: the crazy ones are ruining it for you,thisplaceisashes,1622383317,"When I first tried OLD, I used my real first name and a crazy dude found where I live. I stopped using my real name. I also don't use photos that can be reverse-image searched and lead back to me. I don't give out identifying details or my phone number. Many men think I'm going overboard (""can't you tell I'm a good guy?"") And, after all that, I should be ""safe"", right?

... About 8 months ago, I relaunched my profile for about a 2-week period. No one stood out so it didn't go beyond a handful of brief conversations. ""Brief"" because I limit how much time I waste by not going beyond asking two unreciprocated questions. (Mostly, I get wordy responses where they try to impress me with how incredible and amazing they are... I get it, you want to put your best foot forward but if you only want to talk about you without wanting to get to know the other person, there is an underlying pathology there I have no interest in unraveling. I know all I need to know and unmatch.) 

So, that's what happened 8 months ago. Feel free to read the long exchange but I'll sum it up: a guy I'd briefly chatted with once and, after asking two questions, unmatched:

1) found what he thought was my first name (it wasn't, but it was close);

2) took the time to find my cell number, which required a paid service because this is the one number that's intentionally unpublished;

3) found what he thought was my birthday; 

4) created a contact in his phone with my info;

5) set a calendar reminder to reach out **8 months later**;

6) then lied about all of the above while using disappearing text (which, according to our investigator - a former cop - is difficult to screenshot, so generally used to ""hide"" what people don't want others to easily see and/or scare the recipient, who thinks their phone / watch is hacked); 

7) used a phone number that's not associated with his name via the usual channels - a professional found him, which he clearly was not expecting; 

7) tried gaslighting me into believing that we'd connected all that time ago but just lost touch, and that he didn't *really* know who I was but was such a good guy, he didn't want to miss out on wishing me the best on my (not) birthday, because silly Siri had automatically added the reminder (with contact information I never gave);

8) when I told him I knew who he was, lied about it. So, I sent him a screenshot with his face on it (professional background checks take time, but I had enough preliminary info to find a photo) -- though omitted from the texts due to privacy issues, I marked the spot with ""pic""

... etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a total stranger that had a single ""conversation"" with this person. But I hurt his feelings by not being interested, so he invested both money and time into finding my information so he could harass me 8 months later. (He must've used an aggregator service so the information was mostly wrong but did give him my number.) 

Here's the scarier part: this man is a dentist with a clinic. He has access to private patient information that unwitting patients willingly provide, which he can use in a similar way. There is no way this is the first time he's done something like this, as evidenced by the disappearing text.

I'm lucky: I have access to resources that the average woman does not. He clearly wasn't expecting that the tables would turn and that he'd be the one terrified. But this is not normal. So, if you're wondering why you're not having luck online and women are hesitant to meet you or give you their number, think about what they've had to deal with.",Bumble,

Let's try an experiment...,spitfiremac,1622172313,"According to the 2019 census, 13.1% of Americans have a masters, doctorate, or professional degree. If you ask me that sounds arounf 5-7% too low, but it's still useful.

I looked that up after noting that seemingly 2/3rds of hundreds of profiles I (a guy looking at women's profiles from late 20's to mid 40's) swiped through claimed to have graduate degrees. 

I started counting... 77 out of 113 profiles claimed graduate degrees, that's 68% of that small sample (over several days of swiping.) I live about 20 minutes outside of Denver, but noticed the same phenomenon in Austin... both big cities, so these groups aren't representative of the total population, but it still seems really high, at least 50% higher than the country average.

Does this matter for dating? Not at all... Only as an indication that people might be lying about their education on dating apps (people lie on apps, say it ain't so!) or as an indicator of a possibly stupendous education inequality between urban centers and rural America, or maybe between women and men. 

We need more samples!

I do find that large descrepancy really interesting and would love to know what other people's counts are on this app. Obviously this is informal and will be about small sample populations, so not real data, but if you want to count how many graduate degrees are listed and how many profiles you looked at, and maybe basic location like I'm around a major city, looking at men's profiles, or the like I think it would be interesting anecdotes for some of us on here.

Honestly it's annoying that as a guy I am expected to have super exiting photo's can't just be nice pictures. needs to be me doing something exiting, or being somewhere exotic or in another country/at a landmark. 99% of women on these apps have generic ass pictures, maybe a friend in their or a pet, the occasional ""not my child"" picture, if they are skinny likely a bikini picture if bigger an obscure photo that tries to hide the size of their waste, then the attractive friend in every photo so you can tell who is who. But yeah nothing ever extravagant but they don't need it because guys will swipe right regardless.

**Bio double standard**

This pisses me off even more tbh, because sorry but the vast majority of women on both bumble and tinder don't put anything or ""actually insert age"" I try to put an actual bio that works but doesn't seem to do anything. 

Current bio I am a security guard, I love RTV and I'm looking for someone to travel to Europe with.
love board games, I'm a Science and History Buff and I'm a great cook and Baker.
Learning German, my dream job is to create my own show/success film channel I also love to cuddle.

I can't just put something like ""Looking for GF"" or ""Want to have a baby"" or any other short thing because that's boring or a turn off, but ""hi"" isn't for girls.

**Everything else**

The standard is just 10 times higher for men than women on these apps and on top of that we have do deal with ""thots"" who are just trying to sell shit, or those who ""just doing it for fun"" or ""just want friends"" despite it not being for that, no one is looking to just be your friend dummy.

It's so bad that had I not moved I likely would have had better success by simply going though Starbucks drive through because one of the barista's was making heavy hints, and so yeah, that's how fucking shitty these apps are drive throughs are better than them lol.

I wish Bumble would stop sending me Notifications that people are swiping on me when I have no one left in my area,archaeob,1622069545,"I get maybe ten profiles every few days and then get the ""no more matches left in your area"" message. It sucks but I don't want to actually make my area or age ranges any wide than it already is. There just aren't enough lesbians in my area to keep swiping on forever. 

As I'm sure you all know Bumble constantly sends these messages. Today was ""Keep swiping to find more possibilities."" And yet when I go in, what do you know, still no new profiles since I swiped last night. I know its probably automated or something, but its getting very annoying.

I'm curious after seeing so many women bemoaning being back on bumble what it feels like on the other side of the app. I can sum up my experience like this: swipe hundreds of times, lots of ""matches"" that I assume are bots geared towards getting me to buy premium. Get occasional real match, convo starts with wave emoji, start talking, try to be casual but interesting, eventually find out that we aren't suited for each other or convo dies a sudden death if I don't carry every bit of dialog.

Bumble in Japan vs America,ashuri_bear,1622037615,"I‚Äôm an American in Japan and had really great experiences with bumble in the states. I met my most long-term (now ex)bf on this app and so decided to give it a go in Japan. And boy has it been sheit. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience to mine. My type is not at all japanese, so my only options boil down to military fuckbois or socially awkward guys with yellow fever (this is a generalization of course, but fairly accurate from first hand experience). Back in the states I would basically match with 90% of the people I swiped right on, but here I barely get any matches. I live far away from Tokyo (but still within range to see those matches)but my profile is never shown to those users because I‚Äôm too far out. Why show me matches and waste my time swiping if you don‚Äôt even show them my profile in return?! I know this is true because the minute I step into Tokyo I get loads of matches. It‚Äôs so frustrating and feels like a waste of time. I also have been called a transvestite by three different men on this app (Japan you can really pick ‚Äòem) which I have NEVER gotten back in the states. Literally disgusts me that men think it‚Äôs okay to accuse me of lying about my gender and say i look like a man(i have very feminine features regardless so I‚Äôm assuming these people are trying to hate on woman), especially when they‚Äôre trying to date me?!

Is it weird if I follow up with a guy on Bumble?,AmericanGirl1493,1621883475,"Here's the back story and timeline before asking for advice: 

May 2020 I matched with this super attractive guy and we were having great conversation (similar sense of humor etc). Unfortunately due to COVID we both left our current city to live with our parents in different states and the conversation fizzled out. By March 2021 I moved back into the city and realized we were still matched and reached out and started talking again. He was still not fully back in the city and spending a lot of time at home with his parents, but suggested we grab drinks at some point when he was in town.

I have her added on Snapchat and whenever I do send something it's just a read receipt and little to no acknowledgement. I do get a response from her on the bumble app itself but it's a bit more sparatic &amp; I'm just wondering how long until I just pull the cord.

"So turns out I'm too dumb even for the ""friendzone""",Dardanos304,1621792365,"Disclaimer right at the beginning: I'm absolutely no fan of the term 'friendzone' and only use it cheekily here given the circumstances.

Five weeks ago I got my first match that didn't expire or went nowhere after about three months on the site. My first impression was... rather mixed to be honest. Our exchanges flowed rather naturally, we had daily exchanges every evening, she was willing to exchange numbers, switching to voice messages fairly early and she was straight away talking about very personal worries, but on the other hand never asked anything about me and ignored cues I gave to ask about stuff I hinted at. I got the impression she used me as more of a complaint box about her life than anything else, that she felt lonely and isolated and that she's using the App to get to know some new people. So I continued the exchange with that in mind, thinking that it would be a shitty thing to do to try to take advantage of her situation and rather offer myself as a friend instead. I thought that would be something we could both profit from. I just had to be a bit more proactive and interject on my own with my own stories from time to time.\^\^

In any case, already on the second day she mistook a question I asked about what she has seen of the city so far (since she's an exchange student) as an invitation to show her around and I thought 'What the hell, what do I got to loose?' and rolled with it, so we scheduled a meeting that took place two weeks later. Given my impression I went there with absolutely no illusions about her having an interest in me and was perfectly fine just having a nice day with a stranger. Which would be quite a win in book due to my intense social anxiety that kept me from doing any of this so far. And overall I think it was a nice afternoon all things considered.

Now comes the part where I think I messed up: In one quiet moment she opened up saying that she has no interest in relationships at all and just wanted to use the app to talk with people and is confused why I who put 'relationship' in my seeking has been humoring her like this without really pursuing her like it should be expected of a guy with that aim. I, who was absolutely not in the least surprised, told her that I already got that impression and am perfectly happy just hanging out given that I myself really just using the app to go out and make some experiences and if that means getting a friend that's already a win. I just didn't want to put that into my bio because I was told it would turn people off. Later on towards the end of our tour she asked me after my Bumble experience and I admitted that on my side so far it's been pretty bleak and she was the only person I've been talking to for now.

That the meeting wasn't all that bad I realized when during our messaging the next day she asked whether we could meet up the next weekend again. I had to tell her that I couldn't promise anything because I'm pretty busy with work, but I could try to power through and free up a day, so she should ask me again on Friday whether I succeeded. We still messaged till Wednesday, then Thursday and Friday I powered through like I said I would, but her message never came. Therefore on Saturday I thought to ask myself whether she's up for Sunday, but I never got to it.

When I asked about her day she replied that she's busy, following up with a picture of a park she's been touring right now. I made a (in hindsight inappropriate) joke that she must be busy enjoying the view. Then in the middle of the night she replied with a rather harsh accusation that I'm judging her for being happy. After I explained that I was just joking she said that I'm putting pressure on her by messaging her so often and that I should ""find my own way"". My first thought was that she mistook my attention as 'attention', so I assured her that I understood that she has no interest in romance and that I have no hidden intentions and would just like to stay in contact because I think it would suck to drift apart so soon after meeting. She only replied that I need to learn how to deal with girls and that... it's all fine, despite the clear dismissal. I was thinking that I maybe just caught her at an inopportune time where she was feeling depressed and that things would clear up on their own.

Apparently they didn't. After a week of not messaging her and not receiving a message either I grew impatient and asked about her week. After a brief exchange about her having left the country for a spontaneous day trip. I asked again whether I got it right that she doesn't want me to stick around. She bluntly replied yes and when I asked how we are supposed to maintain a friendship like this, she said that she doesn't like to stay in contact even with best friends, so it's all okay.

I... I... must admit I'm lost. What did just happen? Is that the acquaintancezone of the friendzone? XD I suppose it is true that I have no idea how to deal with girls, or rather with people in general.",Bumble,

Matched with a cute girl from high school,3stanman,1621657337,"Twelve years ago when I would ride the bus home from school I always saw this ridiculously pretty girl who reminded me of early Avril Lavigne walking home. We were the same age, but never had classes together or anything like that so I never officially met her or even got her name.

Fast forward to three days ago, I am now polyamorous and partnered and swiping on my dating sites before bed, and I see her on Bumble. Knowing that odds aren't in my favor, I swipe right. The next day I have a ""hello"" message from her! 

We talk and I double check that she saw that I was poly, and she had, but was more just hoping for a friendship as she wasn't interested in being with anyone who already with someone. I take this as a total win, because friends are dope! We keep talking for a few messages, but when I went to reply this evening I saw her account was deleted. While I am aware there was nothing romantic going to happen, I was really enjoying talking with her and we seemed to have a lot in common. 

Just wanted to vent a bit, feeling the sad a little.",Bumble,

The other 5 didn't even bother to text me, even though they were the first ones to like me every time (I know this because when I was swiping I got the _it's a match_ message).

The situation also made me pretty upset so I didn‚Äôt really feel like talking to anyone for a while.

I had a really great time, we went to a barcade, had some beers, played a few games, etc. He was really funny and made me feel comfortable. I talked way too much but he was cool about it.

I went a smidge out of my comfort zone when swiping on this guy, but I‚Äôm pretty glad I did, he showed me a really great time. And I‚Äôm also really glad he was patient with me.

I‚Äôm resolved to get back to it after Memorial Day, but before I do, I thought I‚Äôd ask for tips! 

1. How often do you check the app? I read somewhere that users are rewarded for daily use, but after two weeks of doing so, I felt as if that wasn‚Äôt true. What are your experiences? 

2. I hate to bring this up as a point of discussion but since it‚Äôs so unfortunately critical to online dating: I‚Äôm a pretty, successful woman who takes really good care of herself. When Bumble was ‚Äòworking,‚Äô I‚Äôd get maybe 20-30 likes a day, and that would translate to 1-2 matches a week. Based on what you read here about women using this app, I guess that would make me a bit abnormal, so...any tips on how to maximize matches? I have a good profile with lots of pictures, and I‚Äôve gotten positive feedback on it from a bunch of people, too. 

I think Bumble has a lot of potential, but I‚Äôm going to be honest and say that it has left me defeated and frazzled after two weeks of daily use. I would love for it to work for me, but I haven‚Äôt managed to squeeze a date out of it yet (mostly because men leave the conversation hanging while it‚Äôs still happening). So!

Just got dumped by my bumble ~situationship~ (NYC).,swaglessnseattle,1621576612,"I (F23) met this guy (M25) through Bumble at the end of February and he initiated the first date. We grabbed drinks and we clicked really well. I immediately noticed how good he was at initiating and following up on plans - we would proceed to meet up about once a week for the next 2.5 months, going bowling, listening to live music at a jazz bar, picnic, movie nights in, etc. We didn‚Äôt have sex until the fourth or fifth date, which made me think that he was looking for something more serious, which I would‚Äôve been down for if he was. I started building up a romanticized version of him in my head, and seeing the potential for us to become more. And I took every little sign to further convince myself that this would work out: forehead kisses, toothbrush at his place, holding hands in public, straight up telling me he likes me too (after I say it first), telling me he missed me (again, after I say it first). We even talked about how neither of us are seeing anyone else / we prefer to just see one person at a time. We told each other personal things we have (allegedly) never shared with anyone else. As much as I felt sure that this would lead to being serious together, I was always so anxious about actually initiating a ‚ÄòDefine The Relationship‚Äô conversation. I was so afraid that bringing up the topic too early would just scare him off. So I suppressed the urge, telling myself that in time the conversation would come up naturally, or he would eventually open up. 

Tonight after a few days of silence, he texted saying he wants to stop by my place to tell me something. I braced myself for a breakup, while pathetically hoping it could be a love confession. Nope to the latter. He told me point blank he wants to date other people and doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing so if he‚Äôs still seeing me. 


I am annoyed about feeling strung along, I am angry that I did not ask his intentions sooner because I was too scared of his answer, and I am confused about why I fall so quickly and he/others don‚Äôt seem to get attached after doing practically everything a relationship entails.

Did I accidentally make an account?,lonestargirl123,1621549196,"I used to have a Bumble account a few years ago and just stopped using it one day. I forgot all my login information, so I thought fuck it, leave it as is. Today I thought I would try to go back in and formally delete my account as I'm now engaged and don't want my partner thinking I'm using a dating app behind his back. I don't have the app on my phone so I tried to use the web version to log in, which asked me for my phone number so I gave it, thinking it might lead me to my old account which also had the same phone number. It sent me a verification text instead and so I followed the directions because I thought it would lead to my old account. Instead, it started asking me for information to set up a new account so I backed out of there. But when I got to the main phone number page, it said I last *signed in* with a cell phone number. Does that mean it automatically made an account for me despite not entering any information other than my number? 

I'm fine with the initial verification text, but I absolutely do not want any other texts from Bumble as my mom lives with us and tends to snoop. She would be furious if she thought I was cheating, which is crazy because I'm almost never on my phone, but she's also a very accusatory person. Same thing with Tinder. I'm 99% sure I deleted my Tinder profile all those years ago, but I went back in to double check and got a verification text. Tinder also somehow got my email address and I do not want my partner nor my mom finding out I was ever on a dating app. My partner would be fine, but pretty sure my conservative mother would disown me.

Men who don't respond to matches... why not?,Tears_Of_Laughter,1621525218,"I tend to do well on other apps, but not on Bumble for some reason. I will usually get a good amount of matches, and sometimes they will respond to my messages, which I try to make thoughtful and personalized, but last night I matched with four men with great profiles that are supposedly looking for relationships... only one person responded to me, and even he didn't keep conversing with me. I'll probably lose the matches for the guys that didn't respond.

I'm trying to figure out why these guys matched with me if they don't want to talk? I wondered if I was ""aiming too high"" as some people might say, but if these guys are such catches, why are they mass swiping right? And why do I tend to do better on Tinder and Coffee Meets Bagel? It's just frustrating because I want to date people that want a serious relationship like I do, and I tend to do well on in person dates from people I meet off other platforms... but I really want Bumble to work out better for me since it seems like a more relationship focused platform.

Match Queue Disappeared After Ban,theOneAndOnlyBigHead,1621484870,"Hear me out. 

So I have two accounts or should I say HAD two accounts. A month ago I had my main account where I did all the regular matching with women. But then, I decided to try and make a second account to test if I would get more matches with a different bio and pictures of me. 

Then this morning I was shocked to see that my second account got banned supposedly due to people reporting my profile for ""inappropriate content"" where I thought talking dirty was allowed but now I guess it isn't. I treated my second account as my main account and stopped using my first one because I was getting more matches on it. 

After a month of not using my main account, I logged back in with my ""Beeline"" having 50+ women waiting for me to swipe right on them. So I did, I swiped until the daily limit and matched with about half of them. But then when I came to the ""message"" section, I noticed they were all gone. All 25+ of them disappeared. 

Now I am wondering if this is because of the ban from my other account. Did that ban somehow also affect my main account via my device/IP address etc? Are there any ways that I can fix this or any moderation team in Bumble that I can contact?

Bumble Rematch Notification?,RNPC5000,1621469872,"I am confused on whats going here. I am male and I matched with about 2 girls about 2-3 months ago.

If I tap the notification and open it and don't do anything and just close the app then the notification disappears and they don't show up in my beeline or messages. The first time I matched with either of them they just let the match expired causes they never sent me a message, even though I gave them an extend. So I hit pass on them the past 2 times they showed up in my notifications cause I was like what is the point of rematching a person who I gave 48 hours to send me a message but never did? 2 days ago I one of them popped up again and I was like maybe this person is just constantly swiping right on me whenever I pop back up into to their queue so maybe I should give her a chance? So I rematched with her... and again nothing. No message and the match expired again.

Is this a bot? Does this person just not know that women are suppose to message first? Is this person paying for rematches or am I just showing up in their queue?

For men who complain about Hi,redi20,1621461131,"I fail to understand why so many men complain about this. IRL, women say hi to a man there interested in, and the man (who knows what he's doing) carries the ball. There's no diff in OLD, it's the same idea.

Besides, women want to see how well a man can communicate and what type of game and savvy he's got to allure her. His communication skills and confidence to pursue her gives her a sense of his life success potential.

Plus, women are inundated with matches. It's unrealistic to think they have time to write a long intro as the first message, and it's not their job!

Has Bumble been better than Tinder in your experience (as a man looking for women)?,ShoulderIsPOPPIN,1621459749,"So, I‚Äôve had tinder since like 2017. Back then, it didn‚Äôt seem to affect your rating to swipe right on everyone. So I‚Äôd swipe right on EVERY girl to get a higher match rate and see more women, and ended up getting up to 1500 matches after a while, with a lot being ones I would‚Äôve swiped right on even if I was selective. I never capitalized on that because I lived with my parents back then and didn‚Äôt want to tell them I was using tinder, plus I was focused on other things. 

Now, since I moved out in 2019, I‚Äôve gotten maybe a hundred matches. I haven‚Äôt used tinder much, and by the time I moved out I heard swiping on everyone ruins your rating so I quit doing that, but lately I never get matches unless I boost. Is bumble like this? I don‚Äôt even get likes from bots, so clearly I‚Äôm not being shown. I wonder if I‚Äôm shadowbanned, but I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong since 2019 and even created a new account with a different number/pictures. 

Before I spend money on bumble, does it actually show you to other users fairly, and does the visibility dry up after a week like with tinder? I did get like 20 matches right after recreating my account, and every now and then I‚Äôll still get a little surge of matches, but I‚Äôll go months without matches so I never use tinder, and it‚Äôs against their rules to create new accounts to get the visibility boost again.

Why Bumble doesn't work well for average guys,SkaredNotScared,1621446721,"This is just a theory, but I think that having women message first does work against guys who aren't in the top percentiles of attractiveness. Women making the first move is still considered unconventional by social norms, so it follows that women will be less likely to break convention for guys who are borderline or just OK. 

I think a good litmus test for guys is whether women message you first on other apps; if the answer is yes Bumble is probably for you. Speaking for myself, women almost never make the first move - maybe it's the type of women I attract, but I've found this to be true in real life and OLD. Random women introducing themselves or using funny openers is pretty much an alien concept. The closest thing I can remember is having a girl come up to me after a volleyball game in hs and asking for my AOL IM name (lol) because her friend thought I was cute - I was so shocked I couldn't even talk. 

It's a trip when I see people post funny things women say on the app as convo starters, because it's so outside my plane of reality. To me it's like watching people recite lines from Shakespeare - like if I try hard I can imagine a universe where people speak like this, but it's definitely a strange and magical universe.",Bumble,

To all the women with empty profiles on Bumble,Karglath,1621444125,"So I'm 30M, str8, in a huge city and looking for a relationship / something meaningful, not a ONS. 

Registered a week ago on Bumble and swiping left right I noticed a stark pattern of women who are physically really good looking, but other than 3-4 pics of themselves say absolutely nothing about themselves. 

And as a guy who has his life together, is happy, a feminist, and someone whose main qualities in a woman are intelligence and independence I wanted to say a few things: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why should I swipe right on you?   
As I said I'm looking for more than some empty sex, what are your qualities? What's special about you? How do you stand out? 
2. Your looks are nothing that special on Bumble   
Yeah you are pretty, but like 70% of women on Bumble look like top models for some reason
3. Who do you want to meet?   
A guy like me isn't gonna swipe right on an empty profile no matter how you look, who's left?   
Guys who just swipe right on everyone or the superficial ones, exactly the kind of guys I would totally understand you want nothing to do with
4. Don't be a cliche   
You like a guy with a good sense of humour? Good Food? Travel and have fun?   
Congrats, you are 90% of women on Bumble - boring.
5. You want a feminist boyfriend?   
So do I want a feminist girlfriend, great! But you start this entire thing by just posing there, being pretty, and doing nothing else? And expect me to be funny, charming and have this awesome opener after your hi and your empty profile?   
Well guess what, that's a by the book patriarchal expectation, so from a feminist guy like it's gonna be just a ""sigh, next""
6. About point 3 again  
Putting just a little bit of effort form your end will increase the quality of your matches by A LOT, see point 3 again and ask yourself who do you want to meet? Are you frustrated by meaningless hordes of guys? Can't find someone nice? 

Is it me just expecting way too much from humanity?   
I once chatted with a woman about wanting to find a smart woman and she was like ""why would I be smart? That's hard work! Specially when i can just put on a mini skirt and get 100 guys in 15min"" And I didn't even know what to answer her lol

"Hey (BFF) Bumblers, I made an app for finding friends I hope you enjoy",TBabuser,1621387475,"I'm a long time Bumble BFF (and Bizz) user. After not having much success with it, I decided to try coming up with something better. I call it Passionfruit. Here, you can choose to only initiate when you feel something really strong about the other person's chosen passion. Like it resonates, and that's why you want to say hello. You already have in mind somewhere you can take the conversation beyond small talk.

My main idea behind this is that I personally find going through countless initial introduces quite exhausting. This is doubly true when I don't feel there is much context for a connection (mostly just their looks and a few generic data points). I don't know, but there's something about swiping on pictures for the purpose of platonic relationship building. I have seen personally and also read anecdotally that some guys use it for gay dating.

Women are probably better about this - I wouldn't know, being a dude. But I have heard women tend to have a better psychological fit for the existing platonic matchmaking models: We3, Bumble BFF, Hey Vina! seem to all have a higher degree of success in matching women than men.

I'm not sure it's appropriate to say what I've made is specifically targeted to men, but it definitely tries to prioritize things that one might geek out on or be really obsessed about over superficial traits. For example, expectant mothers have Peanut. What do guys have?

In any case I hope you folks will try out what we've made and let us know what you think. We're continuing to make progress and pushing updates that improve the product around the edges. But really we're doing it for you (and me, I love making new lifelong friends). So that means we want you to help us shape this over time.

Ethical is relative,good_hank10477,1621360835,"So not the most ethical thing I‚Äôve ever done but I created a female account using some random photos found I found online to see what the competition looked like in my area and I learned 3 things from this experience. 

The caliber of guys was wayyy above me in terms of looks, professions, and life experiences that they shared via photos. 

Girls have a ton of options when it comes to who they choose to message, so if that cute girl doesn‚Äôt message you back it‚Äôs most definitely because someone better came along. 

No matter what you message a girl it is always going to come off as cringey. 

This experience has made me feel incredibly naive about using online dating sites. No matter how good of a catch I think I am, online dating doesn‚Äôt work for the vast majority of average guys out there. You have to be either incredibly good looking or have incredibly cool photos because if not you don‚Äôt stand a chance. If you‚Äôre a POC just give up completely.",Bumble,

There is this ONE girl i‚Äôm very interested in and told myself no Fckboi talk.   She texts me something about my bio, i text her back, we are kinda breaking the ice getting to know each other.

Woke up the next morning and sent her a gif as a double text (fucked up ik) and then thats when i got hit with   ‚Äúsorry I don‚Äôt use this app alot‚Äù


What made her so uninterested? Was it the convos that were dry or is she genuinely busy!

b) They do not get removed from the Beeline

"New 'what are you looking for' prioritisation update, thoughts?",advantagesofquesting,1621243254,"Hi all,

I just logged in and bumble asked me if I am still looking for a relationship, I said yes and now apparently the app will prioritise showing me to people looking for the same thing and vice versa.

I have already noticed that the first few people in my queue are looking for a relationship and there is a minor cosmetic change - it now puts what you are looking for right on your main profile pic rather than below the pic. 

How do you all see this changing the current matching system? I suppose it is basically a free filter really, and is potentially good in the sense that you will end up seeing people after the same thing as yourself more often. 

However, I do often match (and have dated) with great people with no filter filled out, so is a slight shame if I lose out on seeing this people now. But, on the other hand, maybe it will lead to more people filling out the filter? Either way, I am interested to see how big a difference it makes, and kudos to bumble for trying new things.

I got ghosted after my first date ever (RANT),RALPHY88_,1621215486,"This is a follow up to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/ncfku6/ill_finally_have_my_first_date_today_because_of/

I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, mostly because my mother was very strict about it as I grew up going through puberty. I‚Äôm a freshman and incoming sophomore at a 4-year college now, but the pandemic wasn‚Äôt really making it easy to ask someone out in person, so I resorted to online dating. I‚Äôve been trying to avoid Tinder because most of the ladies in my area at the moment are only looking for hookups, which got me to mainly stick with Bumble even though it‚Äôs so much drier here compared to Tinder.  

As I‚Äôve said before, my date thought that I was super handsome and gave me her Snapchat. But I was skeptical with how she looked in the pictures on her profile because she used Snapchat lenses on all of them. It turns out that she was indeed a catfish when I met her in person, and her excuse was that her ex-bf fattened her up over the years and she‚Äôs been hitting the gym to get fit again. 

The date itself wasn‚Äôt too bad actually, I enjoyed the dinner and the conversation but since I couldn‚Äôt feel any chemistry between us, I‚Äôd say she would fit better as just a friend and nothing more. Despite that, I still appreciated the opportunity and can use that experience towards future dates. After the date, I just walked her back home as we talked some more and didn‚Äôt bother to do anything romantic like the cuddles I promised, she just wasn‚Äôt my type and I was quite disappointed that she catfished me. She bought me a snack at the mini mart near her house for the ride back before we hugged each other goodbye.

The next morning, I found out that she blocked me on Snapchat and unmatched me on Bumble. I took a huge deep breath in anger and slammed my fist onto the closet door and then gave myself a facepalm. I SPENT ALMOST 200 DOLLARS IN UBER FARES FOR NOTHING! Even though I figured that she might‚Äôve not been happy about me setting my expectations too high, I was at least hoping that we could vibe as friends and play online video games once in a while, but noooo...she had to do me dirty instead. This honestly makes me want to quit online dating from now on (or at least only date with matches who are much nearer to my location), and the fact that much more people are getting vaccinated now especially helps. I managed to find the girl‚Äôs Instagram and I‚Äôm thinking about interrogating her on there. I‚Äôm just so pissed that this had to happen on a first date that I blew so much money on.",Bumble,

"""Do you have snap?"" And other questions I'm curious about",charlevoidmyproblems,1621214103,"Hi! 24F and I've been on and off dating apps since around 2015. I generally like to stay on the apps until the first meeting/date. It's a personal preference. I also prefer to meet in public as I'm a single woman living alone (with 2 70lb dogs). I will preface, not all men but enough men to be wary of all men. I ire on the side of caution. 

I have a few questions for mainly men. Maybe I can get some light shed on these things I've noticed. 

If I get asked ""do you have snap?"" on day 1 of matching, I assume it's for them to eventually ask me for nudes. In my experience, if I'm asked for my snap, it's not going anywhere I want to be. 9/10 times, I'll get asked for pics and videos almost immediately. Is this mostly accurate? 

If they ask for my number, sometimes I will give it before the first date but I usually say no. Googling my number leads to too many sites where people can pay for my address. One man asked me for my number 3 times within 36 hours and I had to break it off since he wouldn't respect my ""no"". He also asked me some other questions that made me uncomfortable but I digress. Why do you want our numbers so quickly? If I vibe with a guy, sure. But I have to be careful. 

I own my own home. Before, I was in an apartment without roommates. I've noticed that men in my age preference (23-32) will *insist* on coming to my house even after I say no and explain my preference for a public meeting. Is it the prospect of getting laid? I live with two protective dogs, a 9mm, and various sharp implements throughout my house for personal protection. Why push? 

These are by no means all inclusive and based purely on my experience as a woman on dating apps.",Bumble,

"Ladies, unless you're at an actual speed dating event, don't take notes about a guy when having a video chat with him. It's rude as fuck.",Mite-o-Dan,1621206721,"Quick back story...messaged with this girl for 5 days before our video chat on day 6. Everything seemed fine except for the fact that she only sent 2 messages a day. Now, I don't want to seem like I need constant attention every minute, but 2 short messages in 24 hours is a bit low. It was on day 3 that she set up a specific date and time to chat. Once she did that I was a little more ok about her not messaging as much...gotta save stuff for the video chat I guess. 

So the video chat comes. Starts at 7. Even though I hate video chatting, we ended up talking for an hour and it went surprisingly well. At about 7:57 she abruptly started to say something like she was getting ready to go. At the same time she began, I started a question for her. She gave me a real quick answer, unlike before. Then right after we said our goodbyes. 

When it was done, I talked to a female friend of mine and told her how it went. I said it went good but joking added that she quickly ended the conversation exactly at an hour like she had some other appointment to get to. My friend asked me if I ever saw her taking any notes. And I was taken back for a second, because I DID. At least 4 or 5 times. I didn't think about it much at the time because I thought maybe it was just a shopping or a to-do list or something. And my friend said, ""ya, you were probably just her 7 o'clock and she had to get ready for her 8 o'clock.""

I couldn't believe it. Like, not only is it rude as fuck to take notes about someone WHILE talking to them like it's a job interview...we already talked for 5 days, and just talked for an hour straight...you can't remember anything or just write it down later? 

I realize girls get a lot more attention and have tons of messages and guys to go through, but finding out that I was being formally interviewed after the fact, just totally ruined it for me. 

During the conversation and at the end, I had full intentions to want to chat with her again and ask her out on a normal date. But since that day 4 days ago, neither of us have messaged eachother. She didn't unmatch with me yet, so I guess that's a good sign, but now I have no desire to write her anymore. Fuck, I was the one being interviewed. Shouldn't the employer be contacting ME next?

I don't know. I can't imagine what those notes say. Probably brutal. But also could be a learning experience if I knew what they did say. I just wonder what she would have said if I brought it up. I'm guessing she would either lie, or be completely nonchalant about it like it's completely normal. 

Overall, I'm just glad I didn't realize what was going on until after the fact. I can't imagine how even more awkward I'd be if I knew she WAS making detailed notes about me. I'd be stressing over one bad awkward joke while I see her do a half smile and chuckle, and quickly start writing something down furiously.",Bumble,

He suggests coming over to my place to watch a movie. I suggest meeting at a cafe but he says it‚Äôs cold. I saw where this was going and made it very clear that I don‚Äôt want sex.

I suggest this movie and turns out we‚Äôve both watched it but wouldn‚Äôt mind watching again. I say he can come over today evening.

do people still actually date?,Depressedbadger97,1621096827," I never even hear about people going on dates, i mean here on reddit I read about it and such, but this seems to be only on reddit.

IRL, people i know literally never talk about dates they went on, ""whoa im dating this nice girl""

""i went on a nice date with a guy last night that i met!"" nah its ""bruh i plowed this \*censor\* and \*censor\* on her face, i even took pics look look!""

its all hook up sex literally its all i hear about, a girl i knew at my old job told me how at a work party a guy just walked up to her and asked her if she wanted to go back to his place for sex all night and she agreed, no dating, no courting, just ""sex or no sex? no sex? fine"" and go up to the next girl ""hook up sex? hmmm interested in hook up sex? no? ok next""

wtf.

Even people who have ""girlfriends"" or ""boyfriends"" IRL started as just hook up sex, casual sex then they eventually just settled, no dating no courting.

I never went on a date, or had sex, ive never been close to a woman except one time and it was awkward, and before you troll me and say ""how much did you have to pay her hahaha"" I HATE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT!

Everytime I think a girl maybe likes me its ""haha yeah right good luck"" just shaming me and making fun of me for having hope.

A girl kissed me on the cheek one time, and if i tell anyone about it ""how much did it cost hahaha"" it didnt cost anything she sat on my lap and kissed my cheek FOR FREE!

I just dont understand if people actually go on dates? I fantasize about what dating is like, and maybe slowly leading to sex? but it just seems hook up sex is what happens and people dont waste their time dating anymore cause hook up sex is all that matters.",Bumble,

Just did a test profile on Bumble and I'm now extremely discouraged,SnooWoofers9250,1621055483,"So I have used Bumble in the past and had some good experiences, however,  once the pandemic hit I feel like the quality of men really went down.  They stopped looking at it as a dating site and more of a hook up.

I am currently not even talking to anyone so I thought why not try bumble again? I didn't want to go through the hassle of creating a whole profile and fill everything if I didn't find any of the men attractive again. I asked my friend in anther state if I could use her pictures just to see what kind of men there are in my area.  She agreed and I picked a regular looking picture of her and a second one where she's in sweats looking down, so not the most eye capturing photos. My friend is gorgeous but I specifically picked pictures that would be seen at best as ""cute"". I also didn't full out absolutely anything on the profile. I wanna be clear my intent was not catfish or trick anyone as I just wanted to see what the options are. 

I started swiping and after a while only saw like 7 men I would actually swipe right on,  started to get discouraged.  I saw a guy I used to date and remembered he said that he rarely swiped right on women so I decided to see if that was true and tried to match him. After this I thought, well I wonder how many guys just swipe on any girl they see? The answer was shocking! As I started swiping right on everybody to see how many matches I would get it was overwhelming, just a bunch of matches from men who clearly don't even care who they are swiping on.  I knew that was a thing and I am fully aware that OLD is a numbers game but I don't know how I would feel going back on there knowing that the guy I'm talking to could be one those men who just shoots his shot at everyone. It makes the whole thing seem even more disingenuous.  If I meetsomeone in real life, yeah they could be talking to multiple people, but at least I know they had to make a little effort and think about approaching me instead of just flicking their thumb.

I told her I had never sent a dick pic before and she replied ""well, this might be a good time for your first."" I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didn't matter and she wouldn't judge. So I stood in front of the mirror, pulled my pants and underwear down, and took one. I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible. I sent it and nervously waited for a reply. I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic. It was of her with 3 other women, each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the ""small peen"" hand sign! It looked like they were at a bar and they were laughing! I was so devastated! I wrote back and said ""how could you do this to me?"" and then she sent a pic of the four of them with their pants pulled down and they were mooning! I immediately unmatched her.

Question: Is there anything that can be done about scammers reporting your account whenever you don't fall for their scam?,bhuntin08,1620765609,"I mean the short term fix is once I found out they're a scammer, I report first and move on.

I replied that's not something I'm into, but no kink shame intended. To each their own, ya know?


Now I'm at work and m busy, so a few hours go by and I check bumble again to see what's going on. Next thing I know, she unmatched and I got a big warning on my screen that said bumble takes reports seriously and if it happens again I'm gonna be banned (further action taken or whatever). Sooo that was a surprise to me. I hadn't said anything rude or crude but the warning went into effect anyway? What's to stop some random person having a bad day from going in matching with people and then reporting all of their matches? What if I'm one of them and I get banned now because a scammer and someone else that was having a bad day screwed me over.

I assume this kind of stuff is permanent, so now should I just unmatch people as soon as I get even the slightest hint of scummy-ness? I reached out to bumble via their contact me via email thing, but I don't know if they can even do anything about it or see the message chain to know for certain that I didn't say anything rude or abusive or whatever.

I married the first guy I dated seriously, and after 33 years we officially separated last August. 8 months of enjoying singlehood, and last week I decided to see what my options are. Most guys give monosyllabic responses, but Mike was different. Not only full sentences, and even complete paragraphs, he actually engaged. It is no exaggeration when I say over the next 3 days we only stopped chatting (all through the app) to sleep at night. From Wednesday morning through Friday night we had silly conversations, serious discussions, and flirting. It was going great, so we decided he'd drive almost 2 hours to my small tourist town to spend the day this past Saturday. I offered to meet somewhere halfway, but he insisted it was worth his effort.

It was 12:30am when we said our final good-nights, looking forward to meeting in person in only a few hours. He even sent me a voice recording, saying how much he was looking forward to it. I woke up at 6:30 that morning, and reached for my phone. I knew it was too early for him to be awake, but I wanted to hear the recording again. Opened the app, go to messages . . . and he's gone. After scrolling down, I discover he has unmatched from me. We didn't exchange phone numbers or last names, he doesn't know my address, so he's *poof* disappeared. I had hoped, at first, it was just an accident, but have come to realize I was being played. Have fun convincing the old fat lady someone actually likes her. Big time fun to be had by all.

Delete your account

Sign up to a new account (you may use the same phone number)

Complete your profile

Swiping on girls is pretty much pointless at this stage since chances are bumble will not show these individuals your profile so a match is unlikely.

Wait 3 days.

Swipe right on 5 people chances are one of these will be in your match queue.

Stop

Wait one hour

Swipe right on 5 yay you got another match

Stop wait one hour

We didn‚Äôt have sex after our first date, but we did kiss. 

Anyways, I haven‚Äôt been on bumble since we exchanged numbers, but today I received a notification reminding me to check my bumble. So I opened the app and noticed our chat. So I clicked on his profile, and I noticed he added a new photo since the last time I saw his profile. A few days ago? 

So I‚Äôm not really sure how to take it, like you‚Äôre still actively trying to date other girls? It‚Äôs a really nice picture too. 

Should I still be trying to date other guys? I feel like it‚Äôs such a pain in the ass to actually get to the point where you match and have an actual conversation with someone. Let alone meet in real life and continue to talk so like what‚Äôs the deal?

Bumble Premium,Nobdes,1620696531,"Hey community!  


So I have two enquiries to ask about Bumble Premium, 1) being is it worth it? and 2) being what's with the flex pricing? I noticed that depending on people's age/gender they charge a different amount a month. Is there a way around this? For the single month they're asking $15/month from my 24/F friend, and they're asking $40/month from me (M30). I know it has to do with demographics and all, but is there a way around this? It seems insane to me and other apps don't seem to be doing this. It affects all ranges of deals up to the lifetime being $199 for me and $149 for her.

Any insight is greatly appreciated!

Met a guy who who is possibly a groomer,fairy_cream,1620588018,"So last year, I matched with a clinical psychologist who works in private practice. I was just 19 then (I'm 20 now). On his profile, it says that he's 24 years old but when I pointed out that he seems pretty young to be a clinical psychologist, he said he's actually 26. However, I found out months later that he was actually 28 around that time. Now, I still see him on dating apps and he seems to be making new profiles often -- sometimes admitting his real age (29), sometimes still pretending to be 24. 

And here's where the plot thickens. Two years ago, a friend of mine used to rant to me about a certain teacher of hers who has a relationship with one of her classmates. The said classmate is just 16 years old that time while the teacher is already 26. And tell you what, I found out that that said teacher is the same person as the shrink I met on bumble! I confronted him about it when we were still talking and he said that both the school admin and the girl's parents knew about their relationship (which seems fishy to me tbh).

I don't want to assume things but given his past, it seems like he pretends to be younger on dating apps to get younger girls? Is it likely that he's a groomer then? And if so, I find it disturbing that somebody like him works as a therapist and I'm scared he might victimized other young girls on dating apps especially given his knowledge on psychology.

Can Women still be indirectly bombarded by Men on bumble like other dating apps?,4TBhdd,1620572931,"Guy here.  We know the old story of women signing up for a dating site/app and within 72 hours has hundreds of men bombarding her inbox.

Can this happen on Bumble in an indirect way?

I saw one thing in another thread called ""match request"" apparently where a guy can request a woman to send her a match?  Does that exist in Bumble? (If so, it would mean she'd have a ton of there ""match requests"")

Also I'm reading that the Pro version allows women to see who has swiped right on them... which would be almost the equivalent of a stuffed inbox. Can that happen on the Pro version of Bumble ?",Bumble,

Hope you're all well. I want some feedback on someone I matched with. so she swiped right first and then I did the same and the amount of time in between when we talk is like once a day, the match has a part time job and post graduate studies which are understandably time consuming on their part.

But our messages are engaging with a lot of effort in responses and back and forth questions. It was only until yesterday that she hasnt got back to me yet. I said something like if I surprise you one day at work, will you charge me with the cup of tea I ordered as the last thing I said. Since then, she hasnt got back to me yet and I'm overthinking it.

"It‚Äôs not your height, or your looks, or your bio",muffin-minge,1620560177,"It‚Äôs the fact that you‚Äôre an incel and have an idyllic view of how you think women should behave and receive you and when they don‚Äôt you throw a tantrum the same way you do when your mother doesn‚Äôt have your chicken nuggies ready when you want. If you can‚Äôt face the reality that most of the issues on Bumble stem from men behaving like idiots, then just shut the fuck up and delete it. 

Half of you are on a proclaimed dating app looking for hooks ups or have ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù in your bio. Yet you expect a slew of likes?

No matter how many women you swipe right on, no matter how much you add to your bio, no matter how many photos you use, if you‚Äôre still a bitter incel with a deep seeded hatred for women then no one is going to like you.

Whether she tells you she likes you or kisses you or even fucks you. At the end of the day she‚Äôll either be scared to commit to you, or be in a relationship even if she told you she wanted to be. Why is that? Because women are draped with male attention everywhere they go. They use these apps as reassurance. After having about 10 dates doing the exact same thing.

1. I notice that some posts by guys on this subreddit are talking about how girls flake on them (and vice versa), how they have no matches, and how the app is sTeEpEd In FeMiNiSm because girls initiate the conversation and have a touch more agency from the get-go. Girls, I'm not saying to lead everyone you see on and play games with them, but if they come at you like that, run.

He Only Makes Small Talks,Significant-Sea8274,1620448252,"After reading a lot of posts here I get the impression of how much people hate small talks, which makes me want to share what I have been dealing with. 

I matched with this guy on Bumble and we have been texting NONSTOP since the first day and now it‚Äôs been over a month. The thing is he only asks me questions like how is your day/evening/night going or what are you up to. I have no idea why on earth I‚Äôm still answering those questions. Maybe because he seems very nice and I don‚Äôt want to look bad by ignoring him. We did meet once and it was nice talking in person for sure. But it was suggested by me and ended by him after a 1.5 hour walk in a park. I wound‚Äôt even consider that a date. After the meet up I was a little confused since I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt interested. But then we went back to the nonstop small talks. He still texts me every day from good morning to sweet dreams. It does feel nice when being checked on by someone and it has made me feel very accustomed to it. When he doesn‚Äôt text me for a while I feel anxious and would want to check on him. 

So I guess my question is do you think if he is just bad at making good conversations or talking to women or could it be something else? We are both 32 and kind of nerdy. He plays a lot of video games and I‚Äôm more like a photography/movie geek. I feel the way we get to know each other is basically through sharing our daily activities and routines. 

I really like him and want to get to know more about him but I just don‚Äôt feel that he wants to spend time together as much as I do. I have told him that if he would like to meet again he needs to ask me. So now I‚Äôm like waiting impatiently without knowing when he‚Äôll ask me out. Again I‚Äôm just very confused but I don‚Äôt know if I should say or do something. I do not want to seem pushy or clingy for sure.

Obviously I'm not going to be everyone's type, but I'm not unattractive, I think my profile has substance, and I put effort into meaningful conversations. I never write just ""Hi"", I always try to ask something related to their profile, and if not I'll ask a standard ""Hi XXX, how's it going üôÇ? What's your go to Sunday routine?"" or ""Hi XXX, how's it going üôÇ?

I opened my account in the city I'm in in January 2020, and at this point I've swiped on 14,084 profiles and have been swiped on 16,132 times.

Creeped out by a guy‚Äôs behavior from Bumble.

I noticed that even later on during the week (after the extended match should have expired) he‚Äôd show up in my queue again. Which was weird because I don‚Äôt remember swiping on him again?? He‚Äôd also extend the match, which I also just tried to let expire. A few days later I notice that he found my Instagram, which wasn‚Äôt even linked on my profile (same with my last name!) and he began spamming me every couple of hours basically asking/pestering me with the following:

Why I am deleting Bumble,FlexMissile99,1620390121,"I have had Bumble for approximately a month now and am deleting it in the next few days because it has been horrible for my self-esteem. So far I have swiped right on hundreds of women and have had two matches. The first of these was, so far as I can tell, a bot. The second was an actual person who ghosted me one day before our arranged date. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg of the issues. While the scant number of matches I have got is demoralising, what is even more saddening is the way in which women (and presumably men) seem to sift through profiles. I have taken quite a bit of time to make my bio as witty and detailed as possible with the expectation that since Bumble is, primarily, an app to find a relationship rather than a hook-up, people would put store on this. I have a great degree from a world famous university and an interesting and 'impressive' job, too. 

However, it appears people are swiping almost exclusively on photos. At this point, I should point out that my photos are not shocking, and add that I am a decent looking guy. But I am bald and by no means a pin-up. It's difficult to not draw the conclusion that this makes online dating all but impossible. 

So, the upshot is: I'm deleting my account. Good luck to everyone still on it, but for the reasons just outlined, Bumble wasn't for me. I'm hoping to have more luck with encounters in-person.",Bumble,

Me: ""Hi X, you like Sunday breakfast? Cooking at home or dining out?""
Match: Dining our for sure.

Sorry not sorry. 

If people are baffled by why others unmatch after the first message, this could be why. Man or woman, don't expect the other person to constantly carry the conversation. This is evident in the first 2-3 exchanges. It makes you appear lacklustre, mediocre, boring, and if you were actually interested, you aren't able to show it; the other person is certainly not interested anymore. 

Furthermore, when someone does this after several messages back and forth, it's a red flag. They're not interested in YOU or your needs, they're interested in themselves only, and what they can get out of you, with nothing on offer in return.

Why are girls on Bumble BFF so... weird for lack of a better term?,sunlightbeams,1620347139,"Hi, I have been trying to make friendships on Bumble BFF for a couple of months now and have nothing but odd experiences which has kind of made me question myself.

I live in a big, predominantly liberal city so finding people who are accepting about my gender identity and sexuality isn‚Äôt the issue here. It‚Äôs just... the people I do match with just treat me so weirdly! I wish I had a better word to describe it but I‚Äôll add some examples. One example is of a girl who I matched with who seemed really cool. She seemed a bit shy, but we texted a lot about anime and stuff that we liked. We had plans to meet up downtown, but she cancelled an hour before because of her anxiety. I thought this was fine, but I tried rescheduling a couple of weeks later and she left me on read. Eventually we did reschedule because she did text me back a couple days after she hat and apologized for leaving me on read because she has been busy, but she then cancelled again. She went on a big spiel about how she‚Äôs been socially anxious lately. I told her it was fine but I never texted her back after that. But then on her Instagram story a couple days later she made a post about how shes meeting up with someone from BFF that day and how she was excited about it!! This upset me so I just decided to unfollow her, and then I saw that she had blocked me after I unfollowed her.

Another example, I meet a girl on BFF a couple months ago and she seems really cool!! We text a lot about common interests and things like that. She wasn‚Äôt super comfortable hanging out with people because she wasn‚Äôt vaccinated yet but we did text sometimes. She is also a jeweler, so  I commissioned her for a pair of custom earrings. She said we could do a social distanced drop off so we did, but I thought the interaction was going to be quick because I had work, but she actually ended up talking to me for a while. She even said that she wanted to hang out with me as soon as she got her last dose of Moderna and that I was cool. This made me feel happy, and a few weeks later she posted on her story ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fully vaccinated now! HMU if you want hang‚Äù and so was I, so I replied to her story saying I was. She just left me on read, but posted other responses from people who replied to her story question which I thought was weird. She hasn‚Äôt replied to me since.

Lastly, I matched with a person who seemed really cool. We would call sometimes and even hung out once which was super fun! But then they moved away for college and we kind of lost touch. They then made a Twitter post saying that they want to become pen pals with someone from our city, so I sent them a message saying that we should try it out. They then made up an excuse saying that I lived too far and postage would be expensive which I knew was a lie, so I left them on read. An hour later, they just sent me the shrug shoulders emoji which was odd.

I explained that I generally like to interact with someone more first before knowing if I want to date them (because I straight up don't know them yet...) but he countered by saying the other guy and I already agreed to date?

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, under what situation, scenario, level of interaction do you consider yourself to be dating someone nowadays?

Well this morning he completely disappeared from my match queue- does this mean he just deleted his profile altogether so it's like he does not exist anymore, or did he reactivate it and for whatever reason is not in my match queue anymore?

An Impassioned Plea for Help from the Community,dmaster3,1620312658,"Hi Everyone, 

I had a 2.5 year come to an abrupt end due to catching my now ex-girlfriend cheating on me earlier this year. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life and I was left very hurt. After taking time to heal I downloaded Bumble on a whim to see if I could meet someone new and possibly try to find love again. I had used Bumble with some success in 2018 and was excited to see the app and what had changed. What happened next astounded me. 

I paid for the premium service and within a couple of hours my Beeline was filling up fast. I've never done ""great"" at dating apps but I've never done terribly either. I was shocked at how many authentic people I was talking with and setting up times to grab a drink. I went on a few dates, some went better than others but none of them went poorly. I even made a new friend to go to concerts with whenever those return. My confidence that had been so damaged by my previous relationship started coming back and I felt good about myself. My mental health greatly benefitted from this too and I even spoke to my therapist about how much Bumble was doing for me as an individual. Then, on Monday I woke up to a message notification I had gotten overnight. I opened it but it took me to the login screen of the app. Nothing would work... my password, face ID, nothing. I opened up my laptop and tried to login on their webpage. When I typed in my verification code I was told I had been banned due to complaints about my behavior. This shook my world. I submitted support tickets via email and sent them a brief explanation vie DM on Twitter, too. As of this post I still haven't heard a single thing back from their support team.

I have never once sent a message that would make someone uncomfortable in any way shape or form. I'm not some young guy just going on to try and convince girls to sleep with me. I was honest, kind, and empathetic. One of my prompt question answers ""What trait do you look for in a partner"" was literally empathy. I had not - and still have not sent a message that would be rude. My profile broke none of the terms or service or bumble rules. They were all MY photos of me and my face was visible in all of them. I could understand being banned if I had sent aggressive messages or had demonstrated behavior which could have made people uncomfortable but I literally have not done anything wrong on the app. I know these claims are from some random internet guy but I hope you can take me for my word. I wouldn't be sitting here writing this just to go back and be a bad person to people.

So, I lost dates with a couple of girls and they probably think that I'm a crappy person now because my profile vanished. That sucked. I then logged in with my Facebook account and realized that I could use Bumble again because that account wasn't tied to my Apple ID. I took the time to update that old profile I had from 2018 and replace it with what my banned profile looked like and then boom, I was finding some of the same girls and trying to explain what had happened. They all thought is was weird too. Things went well again for two days until this morning when I woke up unable to access my account again. I'm assuming it's banned. I cannot begin to tell you how frustrated I am. The fact that I acted with kindness and integrity and that things were going so well just makes this all the more strange. 

Here's the tough part. I'm supposed to go on a date with a great girl tonight but now that I don't have access to my account I can't talk to her. We had the time and the place picked out but we all know how plans can change. I had plans with a few other girls next week too and now I have no way of ever speaking to them again. 

I have no idea why I am being banned and I've thought about it A LOT. Could my ex and her friends be submitting complaints to get me banned? Maybe but I don't think so. Could my account or location be getting flagged due to using my company's wifi while at work? It's a VPN routed through our offices in Austin. Could my profile be getting reported as fake due to grainy photos? I had to crop my ex out of some of them so the resolution isn't perfect. 

I just don't know why this keeps happening. I matched with a girl the night before I got banned and we actually exchanged numbers. She turned out to be pretty aggressive (she was drinking that night which I think contributed to that) and I ended up saying goodnight to her after refusing to go meet up with her at a bar at midnight on a work night. Her name was Kailey. Maybe she got angry and reported me out of spite? 

I really need the community's help with this. As someone who pays for this service this whole situation irks me even more. To be banned (permanently?) with no warning nor discussion is not very ethical in my eyes. I had a chance to meet some really cool people over the next week and I need Bumble to take an actual look at what has happened to my profile. I had used the service years ago with no problem whatsoever.

Please upvote this post. I know there is someone who works for Bumble on this subreddit and I really need their help to get this escalated and reviewed so I can have a chance at making my date tonight at 6PM MST. I'd ask for a **real** review of my bans and what led to them because something strange is going on here. If you made it this far thank you so so much for your time and your help. I hope you all have a good day and best of luck on Bumble!",Bumble,

Ghosted a day before date. Why do people do this?,FlexMissile99,1620292446,"After a period away from dating, I've just started online dating on Bumble. As I suspect is typical for many men, I must have swiped right on maybe 300 women before I got a match, but it happened. And she seemed nice. Attractive, really wholesome, and we seemed to have a lot in common; we hit it off chatting and I asked her out for later this week and - joy of joys! - she said yes! It would have been my first date in a few years and I was really excited for it, took the time to plan out a really bespoke meet, based around our mutual interests in Thai food and history. You can guess what happened... Fast forward to a few days before we're due to meet, and they've... unmatched me. Poof. Gone without any kind of explanation. Why do people do this? It's just so... bizarre. Not only did it come completely out of the blue - we'd been chatting everyday and seemed to get on well - but it would have taken them all of 5 seconds just to politely explain that they'd met someone else, that they didn't think we had as much in common as she'd first thought, or any other reason that she'd gone off me.

Faster Swiping &amp; Unmatching Program,redi20,1620180180,"I've read a few posts from ladies mentioning the grind of slogging through seemingly endless profiles.

That may sound trivial, but when matching lots of profiles every single day, it's a huge time saver and keeps the list of interesting matches more organized and less burdensome. The code only works in Windows and the browser version of Bumble. It also works in Tinder browser version. A mouse that supports the scroll wheel clicking left and right is required.

Realize that these apps are not designed for your happiness,SkaredNotScared,1620154119,"This applies to all dating apps to some extent, but especially ones like Bumble that present few barriers to signing up and few restrictions on choice.  The constant barrage of choice is meant to keep you wanting more. There's a reason they don't show you how many other users everyone else is talking to, because that would show the real the house odds and kill the illusion that every swipe could be the one.

"""Hi. How are you?""",PhilipLiptonSchrute,1620135124,"So I'm 3 days into Bumble and I'm really struggling here.   

I'm a 32yo male and met my previous GF on Tinder nearly 8 years ago. We broke up 4-18 months ago depending on how you define being in a relationship. Anyways, I've gotten back into the dating scene and thought I'd give Bumble a try.    

The last year was kind of rough for me. 4 of my 5 best guy friends became dads over the last year and a half, so I've spent the majority of the last year alone. I lost 85lbs during that time. I only have four photos of me where I'm not fat and not with my ex, so those are what went on my Bumble profile. I think they are 4 really well-rounded pics, and each kind of gives you a window into what I really enjoy doing in life. In addition to that, I put great thought into my the word choices, tags, and answers to questions to try and provide as many potential ice breaking points as possible for any woman who decides to swipe right on me. 

My bee-line has 38 women queued up, but I've only matched with 6 so far. 5 of the 6 have all started with the exact same ""Hi. How are you?"" or ""Hi. How's it going?"". Are these bots? I really wish this wasn't how all conversations were being started. It's even worse when it's coming from someone with a profile with very little info, and it makes it really hard to get a conversation going. It almost feels like an interview more than a conversation.

Something‚Äôs wrong with bumble. Or is it just me?,vodka2344,1620079369,"About me: I‚Äôm a 24 year old man studying as a postgraduate at uni. Before Covid, when I met a woman that I liked at a party or so and asked for a date, I was like 30-40% successful (most of the unsuccessful times when she had a bf). What I‚Äôm trying to say is I wasn‚Äôt particularly unlucky with women, sometimes quite the opposite, I had dates with amazing women.

My profile: I have some professionally taken photos, I think some creative prompt answers and put effort into my profile to make it look good. I don‚Äôt have any photos with expensive cars, leather jacket, pretentious photos in suits... I‚Äôm just myself. I really don‚Äôt want to sound pretentious, but I actually think this profile doesn‚Äôt make a bad impression and that I have a sense for what photos look good etc.

The reality: I‚Äôm swiping every other day and have the app installed for 2 months now: 5 likes in the first few days, after that: Nothing. Not a single woman liked me. Not a single woman messaged me. The absolute same situation on Hinge. 

My question: What is wrong with this platform? I live in London, probably hundreds of thousands of women use the app there. I even purchased this thing where it promotes your profile. Really no like? Not even one? There must be at least one out of the thousands and thousands of women who thinks: ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ he looks nice‚Äù. If I hadn‚Äôt had this experiences before I probably would be extremely depressed and sad. I kind of am anyways...

My guess: 

A) The type of women that I fancy typically doesn‚Äôt use platforms like Hinge or Bumble

‚Äî&gt; Maybe but that doesn‚Äôt explain the ZERO likes.

B) Hinge and Bumble are platforms that squeeze people for money, especially men that feel lonely or desperately want a woman on their side. They exploit these people with ridiculously high prices and have thrown their moral compass overboard. They make it seem like it is realistic for men to find somebody, when many of the female profiles are fake or not active and the male to female ratio is ridiculously high.

My positive first week on Bumble,Kagenite,1620064614,"So...I did it  
I gave up resisting and jumped back on dating apps, used different ones in the past but decided to go with Bumble cos I kinda like the fact that women can control how many men they have trying to get their attentions...  
So here's my findings and some humble advice and troubleshooting tips, my apologies if you've heard it all before but some won't have and bumble isn't entirely transparent about a few things.  
For reference I am a male, a dad whose daughter lives with her mother but I see regularly, and a dnd/gaming nerd. I live in a village, with plenty of nearby towns in the UK, so not exactly prime real estate, but not too bad. I'm also not totally unattractive but definitely not anyone's go to for a model...apart from my gay best friend but you know...

\- I used premium for 1 week. I know some people think it's stupid but it worked for me, meant I could see who had liked me and not have to just hope those people came up during my swiping.

\- I was very selective about who I swiped on, my criteria was simple...If I can't think of something interesting to open with, something we have shared interest in, I wont swipe right. Stopped me burning out having a load of boring chats, I suspect Bumble may adjust it's algorithms based on who you swipe on, to make matches more likely. And lets be fair, some profile's pictures are a lot of fun to browse but if they ain't got content, I'm not wasting my time. If I just want a hottie, I'll go to tinder for my disappointment, thanks.

\- I, in my first 2 days, got 9 matches, and 7 of them were a full conversation, one never replied past the first message, one I actually said sorry I have too many conversations (I have limited bandwith for sociability, 6 full conversations are enough). Some did open with hi and a smiley face, but because I only swiped on people I was actually interested in, I could open a conversation with every single one. Some started with proper conversation openers. Now one ghosted as soon as I talked about my daughter, which I'm okay with but I'd rather a goodbye message. Of the 6 remaining, 3 I have first meetups with over these few days, and have exchanged numbers, and 3 more are slower repliers but are giving me lengthy messages so I don't mind at all.

\- Now to some maybe that sounds terrible, but for me, in one week, having 6 ongoing conversations with 6 gorgeous women, all of whom I have something in common with, all of whom I could see myself spending the rest of my life with....that's a pretty good week!

So....in my week of fun I learnt few things about the bumble app that isn't well explained...if I've misunderstood, please correct me below....

1) If you get a notification saying you have people that swiped right on you but none show up in the app, on premium it won't show them if your filters are set to exclude them - up the distance and age range and turn off verified only and they all showed up for me.....BUT when I ended premium today, suddenly I had loads of likes waiting, but obviously couldn't see who they were  
CONCLUSION - When new or downgrading from premium, Bumble will give you priority on the swiping list and make it clear you have loads of people waiting, regardless of your filters....when on premium it will respect your filters for likes as well as swiping

2) Bumble is rubbish at notifications...I've opened the app to find someone messaged me back hours ago, never assume you don't have a message, it's always worth double checking. 

3) Don't open with a dick pic....please don't.....I know a very small minority of women will be into it but I have been told by one of them that I was the first guy she was attracted to that hadn't sent her one as an opener. Please guys, at least see if she gets flirty first. And just in case you think it's a prudish thing, one of these girls has told me many unspeakable things she wants to do to me when we do meet.....

I could go on but a lot of stuff is just general OLD advice.  
Obviously if I just did bumble free, maybe I'd have had the same experience, but if I spent ¬£15 and end up on even a few good dates....I'm gonna say worth it.  


TLDR. Bumble seems to have worked for me, because I paid for a week, was selective about swiping and wasn't a dumbass. So if you're not sure, I would try it for a week!

It would be more feminist of Bumble if they gave us the option of being the one to make the first move or not.,loopdeloopanpull,1620062018,"Like if it could be a setting: ‚ÄúOnly I can make the first move‚Äù and you check ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù, and if you check ‚Äúno‚Äù, the guys are able to make the first move as well.

I say this because being forced to make the first move every time is exhausting. Especially if you‚Äôre a moderately attractive woman and get a bunch of matches...my queue is filled with all these  countdown yellow circles and I feel overwhelmed. And also considering that no one wants a ‚Äúhey‚Äù and they all want these intros and pick up lines tailored to their specific profiles...feels like a full time job.

The Women You Meet On Bumble [bitter and cynical satire],Kalium,1620053606,"* Blank Profile. One photo, no bio, no details. Starts the conversation with ""h"". Accounts for literally half of the women on Bumble, somehow.

* The Influencer. Views Bumble as her ticket to stardom. Has replaced her self-esteem with her Instagram follower count. Easily spotted by a profile that tells you to find her on Insta. Totes not a spammer.

* Complete Stereotype. She likes brunch and laughing and music and adventures and ZOMG PUPPIES!!! Has a picture of Machu Piccu and another of that one waterfall every woman uses. 50% chance of music festivals. Myths hint there may be a personality in there, somewhere.

* Emojibator. Her profile is comprised entirely of a string of emoji. Pizza, taco, dog, cloud, dancer, wave, something inscrutable, champagne glass. Me too, lady. Me too.

* Tinderella. Bio clearly copied from Tinder, including proclaiming that she won't message you first. Asks her friends why guys don't talk to her on Bumble.

* Flake. Matches with you. You extend. It expires. You get a rematch a week later. You extend. It expires.

* ""Just Friends"". Says she's engaged and genuinely just looking for friends. Somehow is on the clearly marked dating part of Bumble. Probably resents that men don't take her at her word.

* The Traveler. Bio's a series of flags and airport codes of places she's been once for a day or two. You're impressed, right?

* The Actual Person. Too busy to actually talk, as she's overwhelmed trying to deal fairly with thirty to three hundred men just like you at once.

* The New Yorker. Don't worry, she'll tell you.",Bumble,

A match who ghosted me 2 months ago has suddenly reappeared,throwawaaaaay572,1619977334,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm using a throwaway because some of y‚Äôall are too mean for my sensitive ass. 

I matched with a guy back in Feb. and we hit it off great. We texted a ton and had good conversation. However, we were finally going to meet up after a few weeks of talking and he bailed and then ghosted me. 

Now, it‚Äôs been about 2 months since that happened, and he texted me out of the blue on Thursday and apologized for what he had done and that I deserved better. We went on a date on Friday and it went super well. We were together for like 5/6 hrs and he made multiple comments about seeing me again. We laughed a ton, it was obviously a little awkward because we were meeting for the first time but it was also very comfortable and almost felt like we weren‚Äôt strangers at all.

Yesterday, he sent me three texts all day - he‚Äôd say something and just vanish for hours. Same with today, one text this morning and then silence. 

Maybe I‚Äôm reading into it too much, but to me that shows he‚Äôs really not interested in me, though his text this morning was asking me basically about what we could do together again. When we were on said first date, he checked his phone once or twice so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the type to be totally detached from his phone. I dunno, just looking for some insight (not shitty comments) about if I‚Äôm overthinking. I don‚Äôt expect him to text me 24/7 of course, but why text me to just not respond?",Bumble,

I told him which uni I went to and that's about it. My name is also not visible on my profile and it's just the first initial of my first name. He asked me for my number and I said that I'd prefer to talk for longer but I wasn't comfortable with how quickly he asked so I just left the conversation alone. He sent me a text everyday but didn't get the message so I texted him back after a few days and said that I was going off the app. This was actually true cause I decided to delete it so I unmatched with him and then deleted the app.

Today, I get a random text message from someone and from the profile pic I can see that it's the same guy. I freaked out and decided to block him instead of asking him how he got my number. I don't have a profile pic and my name isn't visible if I don't have your contact saved so I didn't want him to think that he got the right number. Here are my issues:

- I don't even know his first name properly cause he wrote a nickname on his profile, I only know where he works but it's a huge company
- I unmatched with him so I can't report him either 
- My first name wasn't even on my profile so how did he find me 
- The only public display of my number is on my resume which is on my LinkedIn but for that, he'd have to know my name

Reasons why I swipe left,muffin-minge,1619881417,"- You have little to no photos that clearly show your face. Sunglasses, hat, hair in face, etc. 

- You‚Äôre making goofy faces in your photos. I‚Äôve never understood why men do this, to me it doesn‚Äôt make them look attractive, it just makes me feel like they‚Äôre insecure. That‚Äôs just me though. 

- You only have group photos. I‚Äôm not playing Where‚Äôs Waldo for a guy who provably won‚Äôt even message me back 

- Your photos are mostly with women who don‚Äôt look like family members. If you‚Äôre a player, more power to you but I‚Äôm not into that. It‚Äôs one thing to have friends who are women, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to date a guy who‚Äôs ONLY friends with women. 

- You didn‚Äôt have your profile filled out completely. If you answered two of the lifestyle questions, just put your snap in your bio, and didn‚Äôt fill out any prompts, what do you expect me to start a conversation about? If you have so little to say about yourself, how can you expect anyone to take interest?

- Your pictures are inconsistent. I don‚Äôt wanna play Russian Roulette and hope that I‚Äôll get the best version out of 3-5 photos that look like slightly different people 

- All your photos look like they‚Äôre out of a magazine. I‚Äôm realistic with my swipes. Most guys that have their profile set up like a modeling portfolio are just on there for attention in my experience 

- Copy Paste bios. Is there like a book of bios that men use or something? I get copy/paste bios are common among both men and women, but it still warrants a left swipe. It‚Äôs unoriginal and boring, I‚Äôd rather hear about YOU and not what a dozen other men have put in their bio",Bumble,
Am I being too selective with my swiping?,Elzender_,1619879857,"So, 27M here, set up my profile last week (you can actually find it in the weekly advice thread, if there is enough interest I'll link it here). So far, I haven't had a single match yet, and the only 2 likes I got the first day disappeared in the following 48h. I actually only reached the max allowed swipes on the first day, and I spent 2+ hours checking profiles (age range set to 23-32). Some of the considerations I take when browsing profiles (I occasionally make exceptions to these):

- First of all, and probably my most crippling issue, is language. I'm living abroad in a country with 2 official languages, quite segreggated, and I can barely speak one of them. Fortunately, I'm living in the capital, where there us a high concentration of international residents, and often prompts and bios are partially in English or have nouns I understand. I do try to translate the bio and prompts when I find the girl interesting or there are words I recognize, but when combined with considerations below, sometimes I can't be bothered.

- Distance is also an issue, because apparently the userbase in my country is too small to set a max radius. If the girl is 50+ kilometres from me, I really have to like her profile, a girl being cure without further 

- If the profile is snoozed (no distance appearing), I don't bother. She's either not using the app at the time or has snoozed because she's overwhelmed by messages/is in a more serious conversation with a match.

- If the profile is only pictures, or the bio/prompts are single words/too generic/only emojis, that's a no from me. I'm not necessarily looking for a stable relationship, but I'd like to have something to talk about if we match, I know I'm not attractive enough to get girls solely on looks, nor good enough with pickup lines and small talk to seduce anyone.

- I do sometimes go for ""Horny swipes"", basically if the girl is so beautiful/hot that other considerations can be overlooked, or simply there is not info on the bio other than they are active and relatively close.  However, I rarely do this more than 2-3 profiles a day.

Considering that I reach the ""no more profiles"" almost always that I browse, should I change my strategy?
If I left swipe a girl before she sees my profile, does it mean that even if she swipes right on me afterwards, I won't get the like notification because I already ""rejected"" her? If that is the case, maybe it would be better to wait a few days and see if I get some likes, and then risk with swiping or paying for a single day premium to see the profiles?",Bumble,

Just My Boy Troubles,pinkladyapples07,1619846845,"  During the thick of exam period, I was exhausted, underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time, jaded and bored. The past few weeks had been very unexciting. I just cycling through the same routine of waking up, eating, working, sleeping. I just focused entirely on the rote mechanics of doing rather than‚Ä¶ you know being and was just SO fucking bored as a result. Between study sessions, my friend suggested that I download dating apps for a bit of excitement and some external validation. I agreed, deciding that a cheap dopamine hit would feel good in the endless monotony. I downloaded it, set up the profile in a half assed manner and began messaging a few guys that I matched with. One of them was particularly interesting. 

He had a prompt on his profile that I responded to, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get along if you like talking about random hypothetical scenarios‚Äù and so we began a discussion about kindergarteners, sumo suits and a zombie apocalypse. Many hours later, we began to talk about career goals, familial relationships and our peace-making tendencies, social ettiquette, our mutual dislike for hosting parties, our mutual love and affection for cats and our frustration with people who don‚Äôt return their trollies to the coralle. (It‚Äôs mad rude.) We talked for at least 6 consecutive hours. The conversation was immaculate. He was funny and smart and SO cool. I had not felt real feelings in so long and was ashamed and found it bizarre that I was suddenly developing feelings for a guy I had never met and only spoken to on text. My intention when downloading the app, truthfully, was just to see how many guys found me attractive and would hit on me (Yes, I know how problematic that sounds.) I was planning to delete the app and my account a few hours later because I wasn‚Äôt actually looking for anything and had a paralysing fear that someone, particularly a judgemental family member would find my profile. But, Jesus Christ, I could not stop talking to this guy. I had a major essay due in three days that I needed to work on and exams straight after. But I could not stop checking my phone. And I hated it.

It‚Äôs so contrary to my‚Ä¶ being and my general identity which is so nerdy and organised and focused to not study because I cannot stop thinking about a guy. It feels to me almost unfeminist, to let a boy get in the way of my education in any, no matter how minute, way. But more than that, there were other issues too. He was white and he was in police academy. (though he did acknowledge police brutality and all) but I am fervently, vehemently anti police altogether. And not keen on white boys generally either. Then there are all the other religious and cultural concerns and baggage that I don‚Äôt even want to begin to address. But it is just so tempting, so tempting to pursue a relationship with this guy. He truly seems like such a sweet, wonderful person and a good partner. He is smart in the way that I think I need and the way that always imbues conversation with a certain depth and authenticity. He is caring and intuitive and emotionally intelligent in the way that I think matches me. He makes me feel a self-affection. I can already, vividly and clearly see myself with him and can completely imagine falling in love with him. And I don‚Äôt feel this way often. Or like, ever. 

The thought of being with him genuinely makes me feel warm inside. And holy fuck, I was not expecting for this shit to happen so randomly.

I've felt like I'm in a perpetual nightmare thinking about it over and over again (week's later).

All of my friends say to move on and to work on myself (which I've been trying to do). I just can't seem to move on, even when I'm bettering myself.

Fuck..... I wish I never would've told her what I did to make her want to split up. Me and my BIG MOUTH..... get it? From the awesome netflix series. Yeah, bad joke. I'm just trying to make myself smile again. Anyway....

I messaged her a week after she said we should stop talking, and got the same response. I told her I missed talking to her and if we could try again and see where it goes.....she said it'll be better if we just deleted each other numbers. 

I've been crying about this, but it's all good. I need this. I don't want to be a stranger to my emotions. I want to learn them.

It's just hard to let her go (even though I know it's over) I know there's other fish in the sea, but damnit. Why even date anymore if it always causes heartache.

So that leaves me with the other two ladies I was talking to. I don't think it would be fair at this point to continue our conversations as it feels like I'd be leading them on. Plus wouldn't feel right towards the person I'm now 'dating' for obvious reasons.

Anyone Else Do Significantly Better Abroad than in the US?,blackgold12,1619564769,"Hi All,

Bumble Premium gave me a free trial, so I tried it out for a couple of weeks. I'm an Asian Male in my late-20s living in a major metro area and rarely get any results on dating apps, outside of other Asian women. While I know I'm not super good-looking, I feel like I'm also not hideously unattractive, aside from being really short (5'7 for reference), because I have had decent results IRL. Again, nothing out of the ordinary, but above-average looking women have shown/reciprocated interest in me whereas online, I get maybe 2 swipes/week and rarely get any matches, let alone ones that don't expire without a convo.

As I'm sure you all know, Bumble Premium has a travel mode feature that lets you try out different cities around the world. Well, I gave this a try in various different cities and saw noticeably different results. Let's set aside Asian cities like Shanghai, Beijing, etc. where I was regularly getting at least a couple of matches &amp; messages per day for a moment, since I am Asian. Even in cities where I still am a minority, like in Moscow, London, Rio De Janiero, and am being advertised by Bumble as being in ""Travel Mode"" (aka thousands of miles away), I got a fair amount of swipes in my beeline and got matches + messages from much more attractive women than I match with in the US. I don't think it's purely socioeconomics either because a lot of the women I matched with were lawyers, doctors, finance professionals, etc. themselves.

So my question is has anyone else experienced something similar and why is this the case? Are Asians really that much worse off online in America and if so, why is it less of a big deal in other, similar European countries?",Bumble,

We talked about family, life goals, stuff you wouldn‚Äôt talk about just meeting and hooking up with someone. 

We continued to talk, when I mentioned if I could take her out she said she was excited. We have a date Friday at 8pm, I said I can pick you up at 7:30, she said she‚Äôd just meet me there. Obviously out of respect, I deleted her address after she sent it when we first hooked up.

App for Average Dating,choker_ree,1619513499,"Hello,

I‚Äôm a developer from an Asian country and planning to create a site/app for us average people to date. I‚Äôve experienced and read about all the issues we face on current dating apps. So If I‚Äôm planning to develop an app with following features

1. You can add photos from the gallery. But have to add a photo taken from Camera(So we‚Äôll be seeing the real person, not just the best photo of them)

2. No bs long texts in profile description. Maybe a 20 character string for simplicity. 

3. If you match with someone you get a second prompt to start a chat or unmatch. The other person will be notified of the match only after you initiate the chat.

4. You can‚Äôt initiate a chat with a single character. (. , or single emoji). Minimum of 2 characters required. 

5. The replying party get a 72 hour window to reply back or they get a penalty. If the first chat is abusive they can use the report function to skip getting a penalty. Report will be inspected by admins. 

6. After 3 penalties you get blocked for a week

7. In a conversation either one can report if other person is just wasting their time, and admins can monitor the chat to take a suitable action(i know this is a privacy issue, but suggest a better way?)

8. You can‚Äôt send photos over the app. There‚Äôs an option to share the phone number. 

9. You can filter only using sex,age and distance

10. List of people who have liked you will not be hidden behind a paywall (monetizing need to be done in some other way, maybe later)

Please provide your opinion towards this. Will it grab any attention? Or does this make no sense?

First of all you are a total sweetheart and I adore you. You are absolutely doing everything sweet and wonderful and patient. 

Right now I am just feeling a bit overwhelmed with life in general and perhaps feeling not ready to be dating.

For context: I'm M33, living in Berlin, single, have a job, quite good looking, funny as fuck, can cook, her mom would love me, her dad would wish i was his own son(which would make dating his daughter a bit weird), I'm honest but not in a confronting way, i love coffee, playing games, meet with friends and go biking. So the whole package i guess....(wanna meet ;-P?)  
(I even have a picture of myself dressed as Ace Ventura on my profile!)

Now my questions:

A: Trying to get matches without spending money or deleting and starting your profile new is nearly impossible as i WILL NOT put up pictures of my once in a year vacation on a beach or the one sport car i once saw in a street and took a pic in front of it!  
Is it just me or do you normal guys out there also have the same issue?  


B: If i get a match.... Why the fuck would a girl not answer within 24 h? Its not that I'm that desperate... (maybe a little bit...) but you already swiped right... Girl/Man up and at least write something like ""Yo, bro I'm currently busy as hell. brb."" Or whatever... OR mismatch me‚Ä¶ Everything is better than letting me stare at that interesting profile and dreaming of all those funny moments we could have together and what epic response i will write after your ""hi""!

C: Should i look at it as if it was just a game or hobby? Today a match suddenly disappeared and i got really really sad and disappointed. I didn't even knew her but it felt not good. You know the feeling when you see a beautiful girl in a bar and make eye contact?!

I've got the disappearing Beeline, the 6 matches in my queue that have been there for 7+ days without an expiration timer (never had one from the start), and without an extend button (extend button in web version exists, but doesn't work), and I also had a handful of new matches all disappear at the same time this past weekend. The new matches were all there at some point less than 12 hours of matching, then when I checked maybe an hour or two later, all the new matches were gone (old, should've-expired-already matches stayed). Obviously pretty hard to believe that 5 new matches all manually unmatched (as opposed to just letting expire) at roughly the same time.

Just trying to understand before I screw myself up again by asking the question wrongly.

1) Why would a guy delete dating app account, and create a new one with same photos and some new ones (mostly showing his working out / his body). Not much different but shorter bio in the profile. Previously when I match with him, he did not portray as someone who just want sex. 

2) We had sex fairly quickly, and I would like to do it again. If the guy just want sex in the first place, how do I text him that will help me get my answer truthfully from him? 
I want to know if he just want me to do the deed of deleting / block him on telegram and never contact him because he is really not interested and not going to see me. I could then wholeheartedly move on.

Why say you‚Äôre interested if you don‚Äôt mean it?,fragbad,1619401382,"Why do people say they want to see you again and even ask about your work schedule and when you‚Äôre free if they don‚Äôt mean it?

I went on three dates with a guy within a week. All went great, he seemed very obviously interested, he initiated all three. All were low-key day time coffee/walking dogs kind of dates. He ended the third one with a kiss and was talking like it was a given that we would be seeing each other again in the near future. I thought it was my turn to initiate so I suggested catching up on one of our next days off work. He said he was busy but suggested maybe another day. That day came and went - nothing. I asked if he was still free and he said he‚Äôd been called into work that day, but hadn‚Äôt contacted me to tell me until I messaged him to ask. His messages started to become less frequent... 

It seems clear to me that he‚Äôs not interested and slow faded. But the thing is, I blatantly asked him in a message if he was keen to catch up again, and he replied ‚ÄòI‚Äôm keen!‚Äô He said he had a lot on with work, I said I understood and to just let me know when he was free. Another few days of silence... decided to give it one last shot. It came to another day he had suggested he may be free to catch up. I messaged and said I had a few hours free in the afternoon if he wanted to catch up. He said he was busy, but also replied with multiple chatty engaging questions and seemed to be initiating an ongoing conversation. And then he sent another message specifically asking what my work schedule was for the rest of the week. That was four days ago and I‚Äôve heard nothing more from him. I wrote back a chatty response, answered his various questions, told him my schedule and when I was free, and he didn‚Äôt reply and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. 

I think it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs not interested. It‚Äôs just frustrating and disappointing. I‚Äôm a pretty clear communicator, and I like direct answers. I asked him if he was keen and he said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm keen!‚Äô and asked my work schedule. Why ask that then immediately ghost? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm calling it too soon, it‚Äôs only been a few days but this is the same guy who messaged constantly and initiated seeing me three times in that first week. I should just give up on hearing from him again now right?",Bumble,

Ban for deleting and recreating your profile,Fiji_416,1619383275,"What's with Bumble threatening to ban people. I've been on it for 5 years and spent so much money on this garbage app.  

Hello,

Recreating multiple accounts (43 in your case to date) can negatively impact you and the users around you. Users are less likely to swipe right on someone they see multiple times because they think that they are experiencing a technical issue which will, in turn, reduce the matches you receive.

This behaviour can be disruptive to our other users and our community as a whole. Unfortunately, if this continues to happen we may be forced to block your account. Therefore, we would suggest in future if you are having issues with matches that you contact us directly.",Bumble,

Am I wrong for not wanting my butt touched on dates?,FairyGodPrincess24,1619377303,"Whether a guy realizes it or not, pressuring/repeatedly asking a girl for sex, touching a girl inappropriately when she never consented to it (I‚Äôm talking butt and boob grabbing), and making unwanted sexual comments even when it‚Äôs known that they‚Äôre not wanted is sexual harassment and sexual assault. 

For years I‚Äôve swept this under the rug as ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù and guys not being able to control their impulses but I‚Äôm no longer making this excuse. Even as a woman, neither one of my parents taught me about it or how to report it and I didn‚Äôt learn about it until it happened (as a minor at work and an adult). 

There are many women who have been sexually assaulted, abused, raped...you name it. Whether we are wearing a nun‚Äôs outfit or a mini skirt, how we dress shouldn‚Äôt be an invitation to continue if a ‚Äúno‚Äù is spoken. Little do you know, we dress for ourselves and not you. That should be the end of it but it‚Äôs not.

I‚Äôve gone out on dates with guys dressed conservative and just to give an example it was jeans and a t-shirt with sneakers and multiple guys still thought it was somehow fine to touch my ass or boobs without asking me or receiving a ‚Äúyes‚Äù. 

There‚Äôs no wonder women are afraid of many men and untrustworthy which affects the actual good guys out there who want to treat women right.

Wish there was a way of undoing dislikes on Beeline,pocky-town,1619333179,"I was looking through my beeline today and found a guy that I really liked. Good looking, but not unobtainable. Really good prompts and only 5 miles away from me. This is one of the best profiles I've come across but it's late at night where I live so I didn't want to swipe right just yet (with only 24 hours to reply I try to wait until daytime when I know most people are awake)

Anyway I went scrolling through the rest of my beeline to see who else had liked me. And I moved my finger to the left over his picture when I did that so I ended up disliking his profile... and now he is gone. I googled what to do immediately and apparently there is no way to undo this. 

I tried searching for him the only way that I could by setting filters that I normally don't use, but after swiping left on two guys it said that there was no one else that fit this criteria. I guess it will be a while until he is recommended again (if ever)

Super frustrated right now. It's not the first time I've swiped left on someone on my beeline while scrolling through it either. But it's the first it's happened with someone I was genuinely excited to talk to.

"Profile receiving no attention on day 1, even after removing photo.",Lux-Fox,1619274490,"I created my profile yesterday, upgraded my account for 24 hours, since usually you'll receive more attention as a new user and wanted to see who liked me, but had a photo moderated (wrongfully so, I'm a circus performer and the photo was taken during a public show as I'm removing a rhinestone cape, nothing erotica about it, unless they consider my arms guns, but they're nerf guns at best, ha). I removed it, as well as a photo that was fine, but imo, would hurt my online image (I'm also a dancer of almost a decade and I was laughing while dipping my best friend who's a guy) and contacted support.

However, my account still received no attention, except two likes at the very beginning right before I was moderated. How can I fix this and get my account back out there or is it done for? I also did a lot of swiping hoping that would help make me visible to no avail.

Side note: For comparison, though it's a different game, the same profile pics &amp; bio on Tinder in the same day got me about 40 likes, of which I matched with 18.

Can't use Shirtless pics = Can't get a date,Omountains,1619255034,"I'm not that good-looking, barely average so I workout to compensate and it actually was working on bumble, met some really nice girls, Getting about 5 matches every week until the app filtered out my 1-2  shirtless pics now I'm lucky if I get one a week. Doesn't matter what clothes I wear or my description, what causes most people to swipe right on someone is having a baseline physical attraction towards said person, be that body or face (or both) unless you're just the type of person who purely cares about personality.

I have no friends, don't really want any so I can't get my pictures taken with them to showcase social adeptness. I'm into martial arts, and I tried to posting pics and clips of me fighting but I think that actually intimidates girls.

"Technical Bumble question, getting into the weeds",eastbranch02,1619248533,"OK, so I've paid for Bumble Premium (sucker, I know). I've got a bunch of ""bees"" lined up in my Beeline. Call it the queue. Some were the same as those who I had in my queue 6 months ago when I left Bumble and some are new ones. So my perfect match comes up Sunday night at about 9:30 and I notice that she's only 4 miles away in that readout at the bottom of her profile. And it's a Super Like. Wow, my best match in like 10 years. I'm ecstatic. Everything lines up. I can tell she's local by the photos. Not a scam. Since it's late and I've had bourbon and I don't want to get into a sideways text convo I decide I will right swipe first thing in the morning. At 7 AM Monday she's still in my queue, but the mileage/distance readout is gone. I assume there's something wrong with my phone because I haven't used the app all night and I right swipe anyway. I wait all day and hear nothing. By 10 PM I'm getting pissy because time is running out and I want to go to bed and stop thinking about it. So I unmatch her because I'm ticked that someone would send a super like and not get back to me in the 24. I really had my hopes up.

So I wondered why her distance didn't show up in the morning and I Googled it. I saw a comment that says when someone is in your queue and the distance is gone, they have paused their profile. So I'm thinking she got overwhelmed and paused her profile the night she right swiped me. I looked at everyone in my queue and about 75% do not have distances at the bottom of their profiles. Especially the old ones from 6 months ago. Today I right swiped someone in my queue who did have the distance measure and she responded fairly promptly.

 So finally, to my question:

If someone is in your queue and you right swipe and they have paused their profile, what happens? Does your match just go into the void and she never sees it? Then after 24 hours are you unmatched for good? If someone pauses their profile, so they stay in your queue? I actually think this is the case. If so, it's extremely unscrupulous on the part of Bumble because I'm essentially deleting my potential matches if their profile is paused, without knowing it. It would explain why so many matches that have been totally in my wheelhouse haven't gotten back to me. If I want to match with them I should wait until the the distance measure comes back online. Is that correct? Does anyone know the answer? But then again, some women in my queue do disappear. Why would that happen? I'm so confused.",Bumble,

Then almost immediately after we found each other on Snapchat, before I even knew her last name, she requested a video of me, spinning around in a circle in my underwear. 

I refused, and I immediately got suspicious, thinking this was some sort of extortion account. So, to be diligent, I ask her to tell me her last name first. She gives me a name, and I start googling her, looking for any corroborating information online to match what I knew about her already. 

Well, I was able to confirm her identity. I let her know that I did this, and she freaks out, saying that was the creepiest thing that ever happened to her. 

I don‚Äôt care what she says, I‚Äôm not sorry for looking into her. So many men have fallen victim to sextortion, and all of the info I found anyone else could have found, and if she has got the gall to ask me for such videos, she has no business freaking out if I look up her public information. 

Anyways, she still follows me on Snapchat. She checks my storyline. She hasn‚Äôt blocked me. I apologized profusely for making her upset, but as I said, I don‚Äôt regret looking into her. Should I just give up on trying again with her?

Super strange situation with Bumble match,Ealeo-Solice,1619134471,"As I mentioned, this is a weird situation and I'd appreciate advice. I tend to lack social awareness when it comes to women (I'm getting better, but went to an all-male high school and was relatively introverted besides theater, so it's taking time)

A girl I knew in high school through mutual friends and theater ended up going to the same university with me.  We weren't really close in high school and she was dating someone else the majority of the time. In October of our junior year (2020), we match on Tinder. I was going through stuff in life and didn't feel like messaging, as I know some people just swipe on people they know.

In September (our junior year), she ""drunk texts"" me while out at a restaurant with her sorority sisters (small school sorority, not huge partiers) and is flirting a lot (one of the parts of the conversation being: me: ""What's your favorite place to drink"", her: ""Your apartment ;)""). I flirted back, but I wasn't really down to meet up with her while she was likely drunk (can't be 100% sure, but was pretty sure she was).

I had to ask her about an upcoming event she was helping with the next time I texted her, so I didn't really follow up on that as I assumed most people are embarrassed by drunk texts. Didn't get a response.

A month later, we match on Bumble and the match stayed up for 48 hours with no messages. Between the drunk text and this point, her roommate followed/added me on multiple areas of social media and commented on some of my posts. I invited her out and heard nothing back, so I moved on.

Last week (6 months later), we matched on Bumble again (I had found a gf in December, but broke things off about a month ago and had deleted my Bumble in the meantime). 

I invited her to my fraternity's semiformal because she is a fun person to be around and I'm relatively interested - got a really quick response, but she already had plans that weekend (legitimate plans - she detailed exactly what they were).

My questions are: 

Am I reading far too much into this? Should I just straight-up ask her if she's actually interested considering we've matched 3 times on dating apps so far? I'd have no problem just being friends with her, but she seems to have similar interests to me and I'd like a chance to get to know her better. If I should ask (or just ask her out), what's a way of doing so given the situation that won't be weird given that I can't do so in-person (I rarely saw her on campus pre-COVID - with COVID, I like won't see her until sometime in the Fall).

TLDR; Bizarre situation regarding matching 3 times on dating apps with no messages, receiving a drunk text, roommate following me on social media, and my awkwardness/lack of social awareness/anxiety. Advice would be appreciated.",Bumble,

Something that‚Äôs been eating at the back of my mind since rejoining in December 2020,Clefty96,1619081582,"And really, this has been my experience across all of the dating apps I‚Äôve rejoined since getting my ex moved out back in December of last year.

It appears that I‚Äôve been attracting far, far more trans and non-binary folk than I have women who came out of the womb with the, erm, parts.

In fact, I have yet to match with the latter at all (on anything) since rejoining. I‚Äôm not trying to offend anybody, and I seriously hope I don‚Äôt. After all, I am not at all opposed to the idea of dating someone who is trans or non-binary so long as there‚Äôs a strong bond/connection, but I‚Äôm still rather curious as to why this might be.

I‚Äôve been described as effeminate before, and the amount of times someone has mistaken me for a woman over the phone or through text (on anonymous apps and things like Twitter) has to be in the double digits by now. That‚Äôs literally all I can think of that might be causing this pattern. I feel like the market for guys like that is also pretty low when it comes to anyone the doctor declared a girl at the hospital. (In fact, almost every woman I‚Äôve dated was bisexual and many of them weren‚Äôt really looking for a man at first)

I‚Äôm honestly sorry if this has offended anyone. I‚Äôm definitely in no position to judge- curiosity has just really got me by the groin at the moment.",Bumble,

In person they‚Äôre going to be seeing me 360 and maybe my expressions are weird or my face looks off from a different angle. I lost 50lbs so that‚Äôs quite a large difference. And now I have no real gauge for how strangers perceive me because I haven‚Äôt really gone out much since losing all that weight. Before the pandemic I used to go out with my friends who are quite beautiful and I saw the way that guys acted around them. I‚Äôve never received that kind of attention before. Just as an example: the last time I went out to eat at a restaurant (pre-Covid) was with a friend who is very pretty and the waiter was so entranced by her that he completely forgot to take my order. 

So it‚Äôs super overwhelming. I worry that maybe I‚Äôm just photogenic and that I‚Äôll disappoint someone when I meet them in person. But maybe it will become less scary once I actually start going on dates. Haven‚Äôt been using the app for long and I‚Äôm not super active on it so I haven‚Äôt had any actual dates yet.

Especially when you put premium accounts into play and women have a large pool of options when men have less. If you‚Äôre swiping on someone who already has to sift through 300 people then it‚Äôs going to take a while for them to even come across your profile. So the ratio is a huge part of it. Plus given the fact that we have so many profiles to go through, it makes us more inclined to be picky just because we don‚Äôt want to have to talk to dozens and dozens of guys. If you take everything I said into consideration, it all ties into each other. If men swipe with more intent, women will have less profiles to go through, and be more inclined to swipe more. If I have 20 dudes in my queue, I‚Äôm more inclined to swipe on the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù guys because the whole point is to talk to people. If i have 200 dudes in my queue then I‚Äôm being super cautious so I don‚Äôt end up having to message 50 guys in 24 hours. And this is all mainly based on my own experiences"

,moredilaudidplz,1619054658,,Bumble,"&gt;Most dating apps have an average of a 70/30 ratio, men to women. This is usually why matches seem so rare for the average guy.

Matches are rare for the average guy because most women don't want the average guy, and that's reflected in their drastically higher standards for swiping right on a given profile. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that as it makes sense to be picky when you have tons of options, but that really is the main reason. Even if dating apps were 50/50 male to female, you'd still see every woman getting tons of matches and the majority of men getting little to none."

I feel like Bumble is more geared toward seriously intentions instead of messing around so guys feel they need to mislead you to get a match. I‚Äôve swiped on girls just to see what it‚Äôs like for men, and there‚Äôs plenty of women out there that are looking for a good time or something casual. Hell, a lot of girls are looking for something casual and don‚Äôt want to say that because they feel guys will be too forward. A lot of them don‚Äôt understand they‚Äôll get more bees with honey (no pun intended), they just say what they think we want to hear and act like we‚Äôre all naive little girls who haven‚Äôt had dozens encounters with men and can see right through their bullshit. If you‚Äôre upfront you‚Äôll get matches that want the same thing. Very simple. 

If guys are using the app properly, then they should have more successes than failures. All it takes it‚Äôs to answer all the questions, add a few tidbits about yourself in your bio, and post some recent photos. The more they add to the profile, the more I know about them before I swipe and it‚Äôll make for more successful matches.

For example, one dude had his tinder up with something along the lines of I‚Äôm jacked and just want to make you choke on my anaconda. Then on bumble he was like I‚Äôm just a normal dude looking for anything that‚Äôs out there. Same photos on both profiles. 

If I saw they were on both sites with mostly empty profiles, I swiped left. And to the dude who is giving you crap about having 30-50 guys you match with and trying to converse with all of them; the thing is, it‚Äôs not like it happens all at once. Sometimes I‚Äôll swipe right on someone weeks ago and they‚Äôll match with me later on after I‚Äôm already talking to 3-4 guys. That starts to add up so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs intentional. 

I think it‚Äôs funny that folks get so bent out of shape about how many people you‚Äôre trying to message. Not all of them are going to work out, not all of them are going to communicate back, so yea you usually line up quite a few guys to see who is actually worth spending time talking with. 

Just like folks tear each other apart about not opening with more than just Hey, we can be picky on who we choose to keep talking to if all they‚Äôre going to do is respond with one word sentences. I had one guy who I asked like 4-5 questions to and it was like pulling teeth. I was like hey so I see you went skydiving in your photo; that looks like you had so much fun! Was that recently or was it from awhile ago? His response? Yea. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I tried a couple other questions and unmatched him. 

 Anyway, thanks for putting this up. I‚Äôve switched to OkCupid myself since it matches you a bit more on responses to questions than the other sites do and have had more promising prospects there. I love bumble and what they do for women but men have started using that site for hookups rather than real relationships. Which is fine but not what I‚Äôm looking for ultimately. Hopefully OkCupid doesn‚Äôt let me down lol; otherwise I‚Äôll just have to go with asking folks out IRL."

If someone stops responding after the conversation was going well, chances are she just got overwhelmed with the amount of conversations she was carrying.

Ah yes, the old match with 20 people and talk to them all at once routine. Nothing is more self destructive in the dating world than women not being able to control themselves and only match with 1-2 guys at a time and talk with them until it runs it's course."

I hate wondering why someone decided to not continue talking to me. Even more so when it happens CONSTANTLY. I try to not let it affect how I see myself but it does get annoying. It also makes me wonder if more people did things like this would there be less real ghosting when you have actually gone out with a person but they don't want to continue? Do little habits form bigger ones? Just something to think about.

But funny story. I had talked to a guy for maybe a week and he looked familiar, like maybe we had crossed paths or something (small town). I had mentioned that I'd be away from my phone for a bit because I was heading to the gym. He asked what gym and I told him which one I go to. Talked a little for a few more days, then all of a sudden he dropped off and stopped responding. The evening of the last message I sent him, he shows up at my gym with a girl. Not a big deal, he didn't owe me anything, but seriously let the person know if you've met someone ESPECIALLY if you're going to end up coming across each other in the real world. It's been almost 2 months since that happened, the girl is great, we are in the same workout program and workout together on some days."

It shouldn't be that hard of a leap to understand that a more substantive statement is easier to engage with and respond to, and that expectations on an app like Bumble would generally be that the woman provide this (that is part of the point of the app, after all).  It's not unreasonable if this guy was expecting that and wasn't engaged enough by her opening message to do that work for her.  Perhaps he's desirable enough that matches need to stand out a bit more, or perhaps he has similarly harsh judgements that you might have of uninspired opening messages.

&gt;That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do in that situation.

Why couldn't she do the same by just trying another track of conversation?

Separate from all that, it's also possible he could have been responding to not let the 24 hour timer die (further indicating his own interest), but was otherwise too busy to respond fully at the time.  Not everybody lives on the apps, or even their phones.  We don't exactly have context or insight into his thought process beyond...some emojis."

He testified during the trial of Garguilo about his relationship with Ashley, and the circumstances that brought him to the crime scene.

Moral of the story don't ghost, be mature about it and say good luck with your future endeavors of finding someone.  Because I will assume you were murdered and I will be forced to testify at your killer's trial and if you ghost me I will not have kind things to say about you.

Probably why I'm still single."

For pics, I‚Äôd lose the home office selfie and sub in the running pic from your Insta, which highlights that you‚Äôre active and have a hobby.

For the bio, check your spelling and punctuation throughout. For instance ‚Äúdevelopme‚Äù should be ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù, and there are unnecessary capital letters and too-liberal use of exclamation points throughout.

Lose the ‚ÄúHey you!‚Äù in your opener as it adds nothing.

Lastly, you have two ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs (do this)‚Äù call-to-actions in your answers. Pick one and lose the other."

To meet someone who loves me and treats me like a partner and a friend. Someone who enjoys doing little things together because those little things mean a lot to me.

ok, now I'm just describing my last relationship but you get it. I felt like I had that in my life and I lost it.

So for now I'm working on myself. Working out everyday. Joined a rock climbing gym which meets once a week. Started writing some stand up (to kill the last bit of my self-esteem).

,luckynummer13,1619024533,,Bumble,"Well the benefit of Bumble is that no one will have to deal with someone they didn‚Äôt swipe right on. The downside of this is that means the user has to put in the work. So if a girl starts an account, starts swiping, but gets bored, she may just take a break for a day, week, month, etc. Plus she has to go through wayyyy more people than the guys. 

On Hinge technically a girl can just create a profile, sit back, relax, and just watch the likes come pouring in. However, that does mean getting bombarded with way more likes from people they‚Äôre not interested in and then they get frustrated and potentially delete the app.

I'd swap #1 and #3 and add in a pic where you're smiling with teeth showing (may make that one #1?). And add a pic where you're with friends or family. #4 and #6 aren't bad, but you can ditch them for the smiling and friends/family pic(s)

True! Pick your audience and stay you.

1. Snowman pic - I like it, you look good in it and there's a smile in it, but like you said, zoomed out and has very bad lighting
2. Half face + dog pic - Nah
3. For the photos in car:
   1. Half smile - pass
   2. \^
   3. Better than #1 and #2 in the original post, lighting is so-so since it's a car pic, idk if you can touch up the pimple or not. I liked the hair in your original #3 more, even though it's kinda messy, but messy works sometimes. When it's down it looks kinda flat, same happens for me, so maybe add some direction to it or I think for you it'd look better up. I'd add some product to it and wear it up, a medium hold + matte finish would be my go-to, but you could try out something with a stronger hold.
      1. Hanz De Fuko may still have a BOGO sale going on with code: ""YARUNO"". I also got a complimentary $10 gift card in my order from 2 weeks ago, so I paid $23 for 2 containers and a $10 gift card. Sweet deal.
   4. \^
   5. \^
   6. Hat hair - pass
   7. Hat - pass

And remember that this is the date-equivalent of a resum√©, so while you don't have to wear a button-up shirt for every pic, it probably shouldn't be a T-shirt/hoodie for *every* pic.

As for the smile, I know it's hard to get a full smile that doesn't look fake/forced, sometimes I put on some stand-up until I'm laughing and then try to hold that smile. It feels so awkward but if it works, it works.

For lighting, make sure the light is hitting your whole face and the lower the sun is in the sky, the better. You can find some condensed tips for photography novices like us here:

,nearlydeadasababy,1619015761,,Bumble,"&gt;Is 6ft uncommon

No but it's basically a free pass to online dating, saying that as a 6'2"" guy who has always been pretty successful, I think primarily for that reason (unless I'm more attractive than I think, but I really don't think I am)

OK so take this as it's meant and in the context that I'm talking about your profile and not you... you look a lot older than 27 in some of your pictures, I don't think your main pic is flattering and that is a big issue as people will swipe left based on that single picture alone, they won't bother looking at the others if the first doesn't pass muster.

BUT.. I'm not sure any on there are a suitable replacement. You have a great smile, your second picture from a composition/profile pic point is perfect but for the fact it's blurry (I know why as you have cropped out the lady)... what you want is one like that, same vibe, same smile but totally clear.

It's sort of a theme with your pics generally, doesn't matter how great looking you are poor pics are a killer in online dating generally and definitely in a matching model like Bumble. You just need better pictures over all, I think you are a decent looking guy, the raw materials are there but it just needs to be presented in the right way. 

It's tough for guys, we don't take pics and so when you get to something like this it's hard. But you need to get a friend to help, you will need to take loads, play around with it and you will end up with say 4 that's all you need. But if you do the advice from me is different outfits, different locations, different poses (like literally consider it a fashion shoot, take a couple of jackets, change of T-shirt). You equally don't want 5 all in the same T-shirt as it's obvious. Selfies are fine for one or two also give those a go, the more you do it the more comfortable you will become. 

Finally my standard About Me advice... paint a picture of US as a couple what are we doing, where we going on a date... I'm not liking the idea of going to a dive bar or just sitting around watching a movie smoking drugs and drinking, that's what is in my mind reading your About Me.... even if that is representative of you, it shouldn't be the imagine on your profile... don't lie, just paint a better picture of the truth."

Bumble is about reacting quickly to photos. Woman have a TON of choices and therefore making sure your pictures perfectly capture your best assets (and when possible your personality) is critical. I am a photographer and photo teacher. Take at least one very clear picture in which you are FACING a warm sunset with a relaxed smirk. The warmth of the light will make your blue eyes pop and your hair shine. Girls also love a little bit of a bad boy per sauna mixed with romantic gestures- I like your black and white picture as it gives just enough. ‚ÄúBad boy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean robbing a bank but instead CONFIDENCE.

I am definitely going to try and find one or get one though because it does definitely add to the profile a lot. 

Since I updated I did add a [slightly old pic of me smiling and full body too](https://imgur.com/a/fNML1Xd) but it suffers from bad quality photo and it‚Äôs quite zoomed out. 

I also considered [this one](https://imgur.com/a/MQf7NLk) but not only is my face barely in it, my hair and facial hair are such a mess so idk about it. I guess my eyes and my dog look alright but that‚Äôs about all. So any opinions on those would be great.

,AtLeastNineToes,1619010641,,Bumble,"**Pics:**

1. It's an alright pic, but an emotionless selfie - don't lead with it
2. Same \^ but grainy pic quality
3. Good dog pic, put after any pics of you
4. Grainy pic quality, but now you've shown your hair
5. Good sport pic

I'd replace #2 with a pic where you're smiling (pref not a selfie, def not a mirror selfie) and move it to #1. Also, keep in mind that camera distance from your face distorts your features; a close camera makes everyone's nose look worse. Your nose doesn't look bad or anything, just bringing up that having all close pics isn't helping you.

You also need a pic of you with friends or family (sport pic doesn't count). If the smiling one you replace #2 with is like that, then great, 2 birds with 1 stone. If you can replace #4 with a better quality pic showing your hair, that'd be good, and move your dog pic to last.

You should also be able to see your teeth and physique in at least one of your pics. Doesn't need to be full body, but usually the friends/family pic(s) show(s) you from at least your waist up.

**Bio:**

A bit wordy and since you're not smiling in any pics, the first line could come across to some as, ""lemme take you alone to a remote mountain/forest where you couldn't say no, [because of the implication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUafzOXHPE)"". Just say something else about hiking trips that gets the same point across.

I might go with something less wordy like:

&gt;Love camping and going on road trips, but also chilling with games, ordering food, and binging Netflix  
&gt;  
&gt;So much to do in life and so little time to do them all

**Other:**

The pro/con prompt is good, the others are \~ok\~. The ""if you can legitimately hold a conversation"" can come across as sour or accusatory. The ""bit of a c\*nt (...) you are what you eat"" is funny and *will* go well for a first impression for some, but would be a turn off for others, so it's up to you."

Lots of reasons"
,[deleted],1619010243,,Bumble,[deleted]
,thelonegunman67,1619010225,,Bumble,sounds a little stuck up to me.
,NotYetASerialKiller,1619010209,,Bumble,"You just sound super bitter. How dare I not want to speak to a bunch of dudes who just want to fuck me or have the personality of a cardboard box! Clearly, I am only swiping on super hot guys because average ones are not even remotely similar. Man, take your jealousy issues elsewhere"
,dtc413,1619009823,,Bumble,"Is 6ft uncommon?... I‚Äôll have to look, I don‚Äôt have any....traditional photos of me and my dog because no one ever feels compelled to take pictures around me and I‚Äôm no photographer but I can find another probably.

That makes sense, I just switched it to coffee.  Appreciate the feedback!"
,blitz422,1619009626,,Bumble,"&amp; You're 6 ft!!! Do you have any other pics you can post with your dog to replace the current one? 

I also just read that some girls on dating apps avoid men that have alcohol as their interests/anywhere in their pics"
,No_Cryptographer4890,1619009313,,Bumble,"So, you would advice to use Hinge"
,No_Cryptographer4890,1619009261,,Bumble,"Well I am pursuing a career in Corporate Finance/Investment Banking. But the problem is, when I make a good living I might attract more women, but I will have less time."
,MarcusAurelius1815,1619009117,,Bumble,HHaha
,No_Cryptographer4890,1619009086,,Bumble,"Well I don‚Äôt have problems with talking to a girl. Usually when I have normal conversation, I can convert it into a date. But, the problem is that someone are not starting the conversations. Or just say one thing and dip away"
,noigey,1619009033,,Bumble,"Maybe your standards are too high then, you are just shallow and only swipe on the good looking bad boys then. Personality&gt;Looks?"
,No_Cryptographer4890,1619009009,,Bumble,"Yeah I think I set my expectations too high, after I got so many likes. But then they disappeared."
,No_Cryptographer4890,1619008955,,Bumble,Actually the ratio is more fairly distributed than that.
,NotYetASerialKiller,1619008906,,Bumble,Not really. Most of the dudes want to fuck and that‚Äôs it. Lots of wasted time
,ashleymt8705,1619008747,,Bumble,She's boring
,AirStoned,1619008671,,Bumble,"That's a nice line! Might steal ;) yeah, I think it's personal choice and I'm not at all going to say that everyone should do what I'm doing, but I think his reaction was pretty telling... Most others I'm chatting to have asked for my number, but when I've explained I'd rather wait until date #1 they've been fine about it."
,tjbennett,1619008650,,Bumble,Maybe she‚Äôs on hold with Taco Bell about that quesarito?
,Tri-colored_Pasta,1619008574,,Bumble,"People who don't understand the meaning of ""and"" confuse me. This is even worse than the way too common ""try and""."
,noigey,1619008473,,Bumble,Imagine being burnt out because you have so many people interested in you lmfao that‚Äôs pretty privilege for you
,NotYetASerialKiller,1619008424,,Bumble,"Thf, she just got done at the gym so was probably driving home and showering. A quick ‚Äúhaha‚Äù was her way of responding while preoccupied doing other stuff. Besides, what else would she say to that? ‚ÄúYeah! Go get that water!!‚Äù"
,Tri-colored_Pasta,1619008356,,Bumble,"There are a ton of customers. If the ratio of men to women is 10 to 1, they could be setting 100% of the women up with successful matches, and still retain 80% of their customers."
,nottoobadifisayso,1619008193,,Bumble,"Personally I'm all for people putting all their red flags in their bio, makes filtering easier."
,Cultist902,1619007754,,Bumble,"That‚Äôs what my bumble experience is too. Minus the 50 likes, just 26 from single mothers or gals that are....large, very large"
,freenEZsteve,1619007699,,Bumble,"This feels to me like a personal choice issue, some people are ready to hand out phone numbers to total strangers, some people are more comfortable meeting a total stranger for a conversation in a highly public place.  And there are some, yes who fall off either end of that spectrum who seem like the crazy sort to me.
When I get asked for my number I tell them that I prefer to do that the old world Hollywood style and write it on a cocktail napkin and slide it across the bar to them."
,hamgangster,1619007686,,Bumble,"I mean, what‚Äôs she supposed to respond to that? Hyping you up to grab water?"
,dtc413,1619007607,,Bumble,"I get no matches at all.  Like none, I know I‚Äôm not the most attractive guy but I figured I‚Äôd at least get an occasional match.  Not a single one in over six months now.  I‚Äôve had two different people help with my profile (one male, one female) and still nothing.  Any tips the community could give me?

https://imgur.com/a/LFijH50"
,NotCurious_George,1619007597,,Bumble,"Huh? Im confused...did this conversation take place on the 13th? You asked if she was into nature and she hasnt responded since? 

My guess is she met someone else or matched with someone else...."
,Samy_789,1619007568,,Bumble,"It's not your fault, she was probably talking to multiple guys at once and then focused on the one she deemed better. Just do the same, talk to multiple girls and focus on the one you prefer that doesn't ghost."
,RandalFlagg19,1619007559,,Bumble,"I‚Äôm a guy, and I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable exchanging numbers until after I meet someone. But I have had women give me their number before the meetup.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a right/wrong answer here. It‚Äôs about your comfort level."
,NotYetASerialKiller,1619007457,,Bumble,Or she got burned out from messaging multiple people and is not unintentionally ghosting
,Boolash77,1619007384,,Bumble,Yesssss!!!! All the time! It‚Äôs so frustrating.
,Cultist902,1619007336,,Bumble,"It‚Äôs just how it is unfortunately. Most just send me a ‚ÄúHey how are you?‚Äù and then ignore me for days. After 5 days I unmatch, what‚Äôs the point in sticking around? Imagine someone doing that in person. People get busy and most women get tons of matches but if they can‚Äôt send a quick ‚Äúhey I‚Äôll get back to you‚Äù or whatever then it‚Äôs best to move on"
,Immort4lFr0sty,1619007263,,Bumble,"I was looking up the definition of honor, how did I end up here?"
,its_goof,1619007220,,Bumble,It's the best and easiest way to get your match to like you and this person clearly did not try in the slightest lmao
,schellenbergenator,1619007057,,Bumble,"If this isn't a red flag, I don't know what is."
,jrsygrll,1619007017,,Bumble,These are great. The Matt one made me snort. Also I have considered naming my future daughter Stacy so I can be Stacy's mom.
,BlueSkiesOnMyThighs,1619007006,,Bumble,I‚Äôm into nature. Nothing at all wrong with the question.
,void-impact,1619006912,,Bumble,"Ah yes, how dare I point out facts online."
,NotCurious_George,1619006891,,Bumble,Is this real? Are people REALLY posting profiles like this unironically? come on...
,RobotDevil222x3,1619006873,,Bumble,"I always exchange numbers before meeting.

But with that said an angry reaction to not wanting to exchange them for safety is a massive red flag. I always exchange them because nobody has ever said no. You very likely dodged a bullet with a control freak."
,AirStoned,1619006792,,Bumble,Well speaking of OLD... I've never used any of those XD Up to him if he wanted to suggest it
,CovfefeDrinker,1619006362,,Bumble,"Really? I'd be like ""So what else did you get for your birthday"""
,NotCurious_George,1619006302,,Bumble,"I literally dont see the issue here. this is one exerpt. If they only ever responded with this way, mayyybe I would see your point...

If shes actively responding to me, im happy."
,larwilliams,1619006028,,Bumble,"And what I said was none of that - pointing out facts doesn‚Äôt invoke anything. Funny that you didn‚Äôt even copy and paste correctly, injecting transphobia when the dictionary link doesn‚Äôt even mention it. If you are going to try spewing idiotic woke liberal bs in a lame attempt to judge people over absolutely nothing, at least get it right."
,L0sername777,1619005867,,Bumble,? It's...already happening. Has been for a while.
,nothingspecialcrisis,1619005852,,Bumble,"In my experience, people who are aggressively interested in my trust for them are the last people I should be trusting. Seems to me it‚Äôs their way to pick out good marks from the crowd."
,Marco-YES,1619005821,,Bumble,Sounds like they don't have a good sense of humour.
,impossiblebrisket,1619005654,,Bumble,"For sure, but that's why people create Google numbers, kik, snap, etc, to talk outside of OLD apps but still protect themselves."
,UndadZombie25,1619005477,,Bumble,Not to mention the age difference too 35 to 30 hahaha
,realmtraveller,1619005416,,Bumble,Thats truth. He's predicting replies.
,Problematic_Chick,1619005084,,Bumble,"""Haha"" is literally one of the worst texts to try and reply to."
,Due_Slip8620,1619005079,,Bumble,I do have something better to suggest. Not being such a try hard simp all the time.
,fbarton1977,1619005052,,Bumble,"Don't think you did anything wrong. It happens. She may have been messaging a load of other people - it's hard to keep up several conversations at once, and ones where you're just not feeling quite the right energy, or where you're a little less enthusiastic about them, just have to get dropped. Next time maybe."
,Rustrike,1619004929,,Bumble,"Because most, at least somewhat attractive girls use it for either texting only and validation. They would get, let's say, 100 matches and will intended to chat to 25 of them and meetup with a few - most likely chad or thyrone type for the ones in their 20s. Or a perfect ""soulmate"" beta provider for the ones in their 30s and beyond.

Online dating is like a cave age society, where only the top 5% males fuck the top 60% females."
,dmart891,1619004581,,Bumble,Seriously!?!?!?! Lol
,WestSixtyFifth,1619004383,,Bumble,"It's just the nature of online dating. Unlike real life you are competing with X amount of other guys and or girls, and their life outside of the app concurrently.     
     
She might have gone somewhere, had something to do, etc. She might have found someone else to talk to. I forget to reply all the time and sometimes I'll get back to it and other times I move on to the next match, and new conversation when I come back."
,KatCosp,1619004310,,Bumble,At your service
,SalmonApplecream,1619004170,,Bumble,"&gt;loves animals

&gt;willing to execute them 

What"
,Rusty-Hinge,1619004027,,Bumble,"Don't feel bad, some people just overreact to what they interpret as not being trusted.

I prefer not to give my number out any more.  Last time I did, she searched it and mentioned a lot of things I'd not mentioned to her yet (business name, which lead to my name, which lead to a friend request on Facebook about a month after our first and last date lol)

Happy to exchange numbers before the second date though."
,nearlydeadasababy,1619003801,,Bumble,"It's a pretty good profile.. main advice is About Me isn't really a chance to say things about you... it's a change to create a vision about US. It needs to read like an elevator pitch for a date, what are we doing where are we going... not directly but paint a picture on what you are like via the things you do if that makes sense.

As it stands it's coming off as... sorry too busy to actually date you or take you anywhere nice."
,Immort4lFr0sty,1619003646,,Bumble,"""I need a way to flag my bots as verified so less people notice, pls halp"""
,hugyoutillyoufart,1619003603,,Bumble,"And yet, I am still single as well. 
There is a song I've always loved: ""if I'm a spinster for the rest of my life, my arms will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights."""
,nearlydeadasababy,1619003580,,Bumble,"You don't get many opportunites to say things in Bumble so two things don't waste the ones you do have and second don't be negative or needy. 

By all means make a joke, but don't over do it."
,Positive_Thinking238,1619003524,,Bumble,"It is attractive but bragging about it in a bio is not. If you are successful then show me that by behavior - good manners, pick the girl up, nicer place for the date instead of a dive bar"
,nearlydeadasababy,1619003519,,Bumble,"It's a good profile and I like your pictures generally as a good mix but I don't think your main pic is going to work too well. 

What you really want is the pic of you with the two guys BUT without them if that makes sense. It's nice, you have a nice smile and it's not as in your face as your main one, but of course it's difficult to replicate that as it's clear it's a candid pic where you are naturally happy and having fun. 

Unfortunately due to the ""composition"" it wouldn't work as a cropped photo."
,Rubacavacalavera,1619003430,,Bumble,"Haha, didn't saw that at first"
,beartobeast,1619003400,,Bumble,definitely a good call not giving him your number.

,nottoobadifisayso,1619003209,,Bumble,"Yeah fair enough, I wouldn't change your approach out of the mild annoyance it gives men (including myself). I realise its probably a bit different meeting strangers as a women."
,34at110anddown,1619003049,,Bumble,"Uh, why?

It would have taken less time to actually do it than to post on Reddit."

,Unique_Pencil_Party,1619002292,,Bumble,He's WAAAYYYYY too young for that.
,AirStoned,1619002276,,Bumble,"Yeah, though if he was worried about catfishing etc he could have asked for a video chat or more pictures? I do have a verified profile though idk how much that counts for. 

I get that it can be tiring for men when women assume you're a potentially murderer/abuser/stalker, but it's pretty tiring having to be on guard for that sort of thing too!"
,nottoobadifisayso,1619002223,,Bumble,"It's fine mate, maybe 'are you into hiking?' is marginally better but can't be the deal breaker. I would say don't overthink it, very easy to do! I still overthink this shit all the time."
,AirStoned,1619002153,,Bumble,"That's totally understandable and, assuming the date goes well, I'd exchange numbers at that point usually"
,AirStoned,1619002112,,Bumble,"I think if you meet, you can meet in a public place, go home alone, and not risk too much other than them knowing that you look like which they already do, but if they have your phone number they can harass you (which happened to me before, and even blocking them isn't that helpful if they're able to use other phones)."

,impossiblebrisket,1619001491,,Bumble,"I'd probably unmatch too.  So many people waste your time and the Bumble app is horrid for conversation.   Why not just use snap or kik or something easier to talk over that can still conceal your number?  It gets a little frustrating as a guy having women assume you're a murderer also.  There are much better ways to handle that, imo.

I'm also guessing this guy has had women ghost him or has been cat fished.  You can share more pictures and it's easier to verify someone off bumble."

That said, I prefer to swap numbers just before a date (I'm a man) as I find it makes logistics way easier, I  hate using the app to for real time messaging. If women don't want to exchange numbers, no stress, but I won't message them again on the app after the date. I figure if they still don't trust me (or like me) enough to give me their number after meeting in person, its not going anywhere."

,PmMeAnythingLetsChat,1619000956,,Bumble,"That's one of the paradoxes I really don't understand about these apps. Their interest is, by definition, the exact opposite of the user.

,Hippo_Operator,1619000427,,Bumble,"I always swap numbers before I meet. I'm always worried I'll be in a situation where I can't access the app and I'm due to meet someone.

Also, if you don't trust someone enough to give them your number then you shouldn't trust them enough to meet.

Just my opinion, obviously you think differently and that's cool too."
,daisyforjay,1619000381,,Bumble,"Having the same problem. I‚Äôll have people in my beeline then 20 mins later they‚Äôre all gone. Then they come back, then disappear again. Or my beeline won‚Äôt load."

This is what I call a burst interaction. Happens a lot, it's basically where the two of you are on line the same time, there is a quick back and forth but there really isn't any commitment/interest on one side. 

I'm sure we could give you pointers, but I doubt there is anything you could say which would have radically changed the outcome."

I would say that if the photo is from years ago it might not be super appropriate for today, but it isn't bad! It's a little grainy though, IMO.

You could even just ask strangers to take photos of you in front of landmarks or something?"

Yeahhhh about that... all my friends moved to university and left me here by myself so I don‚Äôt have any hence why I‚Äôm looking to meet new people. I have a couple pics of my with my dog where I‚Äôm smiling but my hair is a mess and I need a shave in them too haha. I can try to get myself in situations though. Thanks for the advice.

,minun_v2,1618998963,,Bumble,"No time like the present! I'd say bio-wise that's a bit of an improvement. Next step is to get over the camera-shyness. Next time you're with friends (I see from your profile you're UK - pubs are open now! Push for a beer garden trip maybe?) don't be afraid to be \*that guy\*. Maybe your mates will take the piss a little if you ask them to take photos, but they'll probably also understand."

Your comment resonates with me. All those personality traits you listed, at the end. Sounds close to what my friends say about me. I get along well with them.

But when I am invited by one of them, usually the ones who are married or are not single. I'll show up to the event without any expectations or ulterior motives to have sexual intercourse with the single women there, nor to meet my proverbial soulmate. Nevertheless I'll be treated as a leper. Mind you... I would have refrained from doing awful jests or have any delusions of grandeur of being the center of attention, due to my comedic prowess. 

I can recall an instant where I showed up to a party. I said no more than one or two things, like introducing myself to someone I have not yet been acquainted to, irregardless of their gender. I was then told, while the occasion was at its conclusuon. That I was too wordy... üòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòè... by a friend, to my associate's girlfriend.

Women say men are superficial. On the surface that might seem true. But as you scratch beneath the surface, you will realize that things like height and even their body types, will get any attractive or even agreeable man shut down from wooing their paramour. 

I have often witnessed many a man, from heights 5 foot and 9 inches and beyond, getting away with the utmost offensive behaviour, in many social situations, especially with women.

My height is 5 foot 7 inches, to whom it may concern. A height I lament, very much. It deters any chance of gaining affection from women so much. That I am considering becoming a homosexual.

üòí I hope you find that rephrasing more... ""sober"".

,Mistygirl179,1618983511,,Bumble,"Ive heard sites like that that work because more of those users aren‚Äôt looking for anything substantial.

,Glittering_Regular38,1618983438,,Bumble,"Dishonesty is never a good idea. If you think a woman won't like you, because you are 5'9, why do you think she will respond well, in person. Keep in mind, women measure their heights without shoes, too. Women will also be taller, in their shoes, and your height discrepancy will be just as noticeable."
,AtLeastNineToes,1618983420,,Bumble,"**Pics:**

1. I like the lighting and smile, but you're slouching
2. Lighting sucks on your face, you can keep it but move it further than #2
3. Awkward posture, good lighting
4. Solid nature pic
5. Lighting is so-so, I'd ditch this one or #2

You need a pic that includes friends or family. I would work on improving your posture, even if only for pictures. I know I mentioned #3, but everyone will have an awkward posture during a solo pic in a park. I'm talking more about the slouching.

And imo you would look better without the under beard - at least none on your neck. This is coming from a straight guy (27 yo) who can barely grow any facial hair, so take it with a huge grain of salt, but I think a ducktail beard would look good on you. Ik that can take forever to grow, but just saying.

**Bio:**

&gt;My typical past times include misplacing guitar picks, drinking yerba mate hot and screaming at the radio during the puzzle segment on Weekend Edition. \[ \]  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not looking for anything specific. Also, I'm now fully vaccinated for covid.

Pretty wordy. Your basic info already says you don't know what you're looking for yet, so no need to mention it in bio. Not to be harsh, but mentioning the specific tea brand and the radio puzzle segment makes you sound lame. Let's ditch 'em. I'd go with something like:

&gt;Love teaching, playing guitar, and rewatching The Office 10 times in a row  
&gt;  
&gt;Vaccinated!

You can change the rewatching part to a different show or a different relatable action

**Other:**

I like the prompt for ""Swipe Right If..."" because your answer is short 'n sweet. The others you should re-do. The Seinfeld one is a maybe, but seems unrelatable for most under 30s. The gym cliche one is too wordy and makes it seem like you're trying to be elitist or ""nOT lIkE ThE oTHeR gUyS"" so just say ""out on a run, love being outside!"""

3. Good pic
4. Meme to end it is fine, but would prefer a 4th pic of you and move the meme to #5

You don't show teeth and you only have a single half-smile picture. You should have 1 pic that includes friends or family.

**Bio:**

&gt;looking for someone who prefers bepis over conk and mcdonald's over kfc

It's ok. You could change it, but I don't think this will make/break getting matches.

1. Fine, better if you were smiling
2. Grainy quality, still no smile
3. Bathroom selfies are ok if not leading with them, but still no smile
4. **No** - you can have 1 weird+quirky pic if you've already come across as goofy, but you've chosen straight-faced, so this pic seems more like weird+creepy

You look good in the 1st pic, but the rest don't really help. You need at least 1 pic where you're smiling (pref as #1 or #2) and at least 1 pic where you're with friends or family.

And along with the smile bit, at least 1 with teeth showing preferred, otherwise we have to assume your teeth are as bad as possible.

**Bio:**

&gt;let me be your hobbit

Ehhh you can do better. Bios don't need to be 2 paragraphs long, but you'd like to leave a conversation starter or two or to say something about yourself. Keeping it short 'n simple as it seems to suit you and based on the info in your profile I'd go with something like:

&gt;History nerd  
&gt;  
&gt;My hair has a mind of its own  
&gt;  
&gt;Coffee date?

**Other:**

Your prompts are ""out there"". If someone already had the chance to get to know you and then saw your prompts, I'm sure it'd be fine, but otherwise your first impression is coming on strong, and not in a good way. I'd say to go through prompts again and pick ""safer"" answers. It's fine if they're really short or if you omit the prompts entirely."

It should be about you. Get rid of the financial joke at the end. Makes you sound poor, even if you aren't, you don't want a girl to think about your financial situation.

Well on the Venn diagram I've just drawn up on my whiteboard (which you can't see from home) sarcasm and humour can definitely overlap at times.

&gt;everyone thinks sarcasm is hilarious these days and don‚Äôt quite understand the actual definition of it. 

Are you saying there is widespread confusion over the definition of sarcasm?  And this is the reason that some people (or lots of people) find sarcasm hilarious?

Do you know how set boundaries and enforce them. Are you brave enough to get up and leave when Tylor is a prick?  


Do you have a plan for when Jayden gets sexual and you just aren't at the level.   
Do you know what it takes for you to be comfortable with a sexaual situation?

I have never in my life run a mile under 8 minutes. 5k in 20 is a 6.5 minute mile pace for over 3 miles. I would posit anyone who is doing that, or even knows that that is their time, is a trained runner.

But the larger point, and why I assume your first post got a parade of downvotes (haven't bothered to read all the hate) is that it isn't about whether someone is capable of doing it. Going to Venice for holiday and then still actually taking the time to go for a 5k run every morning is not a personality type that everyone wants to be dating. Most people want to be allowed not to be intense 24x7 and be capable of relaxing."

Any confident ugly man is still an ugly man. Ugly short men are not given a chance by women because of their apperreance. What matters first is apperreance, cause after that women will give them a chance and talk to them and get to them but if they ar eohysically unattractive then they can be the sweetest man alive they will never get a chance to talk. That is what my experiences had taught me. And the vibe I give off is fine, trust me, my personality is not the issue and I will never blame myself ever again cause the last time I blamed myself for my fialures with women I attempted suicide."

,RobotDevil222x3,1618935326,,Bumble,"I see them a lot so I dont think everyone has to dispute to keep them up. From Bumble's policy, which has the aim of getting rid of the shirtless mirror selfie:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bikinis and swimwear pics are only okay if you are outdoors; for example, in a pool or at the beach. But if you‚Äôre indoors, that‚Äôs a no-no, since it looks too much like underwear. 

&amp;#x200B;

So your example is explicitly called out as OK. I would guess that some bitter guy is going around reporting photos and they just use a computer to pull reported photos rather than pay someone to sit there and read through each case. So disputing may be your only option."

,KingDebone,1618899934,,Bumble,"Running is a great way to see a large part of the local area without taking up a huge amount of time, finding restaurants, checking out local trails, just generally getting a vibe for the town/city you're in. That being said if you're not already active then you're not going to be able to focus on any of that.



I enjoy running and so so every day, including holidays. When I am on holiday I'll typically get up earlier than the people I'm with and get it out the way, sometimes that includes packing a bag and having them meet me in the next town over with the bag for breakfast. If there's a local race on I will probably enter it but that's my undertaking. You chill by the pool while I go do this thing!!



Conversely, a holiday sitting by a pool in a hotel just sounds tedious to me. If that's you're idea of a holiday then I'm out. There has to be a middle ground."

Or a million other things. You're a stranger she's never met before. It makes sense to not be *that invested*. For me, it's generally not a conscious decision it just happens. I match with too many people at once &amp; don't have the time to keep up with everyone. Ive ghosted guys I was into because I wanted to come up with something clever, got busy, and forgot.

,jokotofo,1618889222,,Bumble,"Okay, so, OP is most likely in the top 15% of earners in the United States (considering he's a software engineer). For his age, he's probably closer to the top 7%. He's also not a bad looking guy.  In other words, his value in the dating marketplace is INCREDIBLY HIGH.  

There are studies that show that dating apps have lowered self esteem in men. Which might explains why a man like OP is willing to settle for a single mom with 3 kids. 

Unpopular opinion here, but let's be real, there's a REASON why someone with three kids is a single mom.

Why should OP give his resources to take care of someone's 3 kids? A mom's FIRST priority is HER KIDS. Her man is probably the 5th person on her list of priorities. Why would OP deal with the kind of drama that comes along with trying to be a step-father? He doesn't have time for that.

OP deserves better. There are women out there for him that want a family, want marriage, and are NOT the ""self-consumed"" type that you're describing. He's just looking in the wrong place. Dating apps are NOT it."

Any number of things could've happened with her, or with your previous matches who've stopped responding. I'm sure it's not been the same in every case so it's hard to say or offer thoughts there. 

I say this with complete kindness and empathy and I know it sucks to be left confused: please don't assume that someone matching with you means you have it in the bag. Same goes for someone sending a message. Unfortunately things can be pretty tentative in the beginning, so don't ruminate on a question like this one. It's not good for you, or for them, or for your future matches, if you wonder why someone would give you a chance if they aren't going to be interested forever. It's a dead end, my friend. You have to give people the space to change their minds, or for other things to come up, or for it to just not be what they're looking for at this time, or any number of things. It's best not to speculate too much and just to control what you can control as you move forward. 

I know not having closure can sometimes suck. Ultimately if you can look back on your messages HONESTLY/CRITICALLY and not see any big mistakes or red flags that you raised, you don't have to take this question on and make it your business or problem. Just carry on. :)

And he wasn't using any filters. It was weird. I think I just didn't like 'him' in person. He also looked a LOT shorter, in person.

There was another guy, that I didn't get the chance to meet, in person, but I spotted him at the grocery store, one night, and he confirmed that he was there. He looked about 40 pounds heavier than his bumble picture and I found that irritating because he had, recently, been upset about a girl, he met, looking about 20 pounds heavier than her pictures and he made a point of calling her deceitful.

,lgbuzzsaw,1618881147,,Bumble,"Oh, the ""apolitical"" tag isn't all that ironic. They probably view themselves as a ""freethinker."" My late wife's maid of honor is that type of person. They're not very smart (like this person from the profile, they only have a high school education) and I suspect they know it and so, instead of putting in the work to educate themself (because who wants to do work?), they come up with rationalizations for why, actually, they really are smart.

Anyway...the ""desire to want to see more long term effects"" is...a tough one. It does seem somewhat rational, but it rubs me as one of those rationalizations to hide less socially acceptable views. Part of my suspicion on that is because it's not really that rational. The long term effects of COVID-19 don't look to be all that great so it seems to me they're not doing a complete cost-benefit analysis. It would seem they're only doing the analysis so far as it arrives at the conclusion they desired. And then there's the problem of ignoring the impact on others, though that gets into the is-ought problem, which is then separate from the rationality of the viewpoint."

Also, the guy can't tell if you are the person on the right or left on your main pic. I can assure you that some guys swipe right thinking you are the one on the left, but then after first message look more carefully and realize you are the one on the right.

Adventure buddy sounds like you‚Äôre not taking it seriously and just looking for a friend; no guy wants to be in the friendzone. I have a lot of wigs definitely sounds like you‚Äôre insecure about your natural appearance, and that can definitely freak out a guy.
Some guys are into curvy chicks and other dudes are not, hence why i said you‚Äôre gorgeous. Based on the pics that I‚Äôm seeing in your profile, it looks to me like you‚Äôre insecure about your looks. Don‚Äôt be. Any chick that is confident about her body image, no matter how thick/curvy/slim/thin they are, is a turn on. The truth may hurt, but someone had to tell you the truth. Don‚Äôt give up.

If you're that scared then maybe Bumble or online dating isn't for you. You were likely getting reported because you are unintentionally giving off catfish vibes.

I apologize to any women who get offended by my next paragraph. But that statement is from my own interactions with the opposite sex on Tinder/Bumble/hinge/blah blah blah. 

These apps may have been the bee's knees back in the day, but they are just absolute trash now. Full of bots, scammers, and self absorbed little girls who want to validation and have nothing to offer in terms of life fulfillment.

With any online dating, your best bet is to look at Bumble/Tinder/match/whatever as just another avenue to meet someone.  Not as the only road to a relationship. 

Take it easy, just do a few swipes a day on your break, and feel fine to be picky. No need to be in a rush.

Too wordy. Try something basic or (a little) witty. Just say ""Accountant"".

Can exclude it entirely since it's already mentioned as your profession.

&gt;""Classic nerd: video/board games, star wars, &amp; LOTR.""

Great 10/10

&gt;""Foodie: fine with a fancy brunch or a crazy dive.""

Good 8/10, could nitpick being wordy or not interesting beyond the ""Foodie"" part. If there was a short way to offer a conversation starter as a follow-up to foodie, that'd be great!

&gt;""Would like to visit Japan again someday.""

Great 10/10, not too wordy and gives a perfect chance for a conversation starter

**Interests:**

Could adjust these since you've already mentioned video games, board games, and being a foodie, but no problem.

**Last meal:**

&gt;Saag Paneer (...)

Gets a bit wordy, I'd shorten to: ""Saag Paneer - great childhood memories""

**Pros/Cons:**

A bit wordy, I'd say:

""Pro: Honest. Con: Shy when first meeting!""

Drop the ""maybe"" part and drop the emoji, imo they make you come off as twice as shy as you'd probably want.

**Zombie apocalypse plan:**

Too serious of an answer imo. Like, *yes*, it's a good plan, but we want to be interesting on this app, not ""right"".

**Pics:**

**#1** good, but don't lead with it

**#2** grainy picture quality - I know it's there to say, ""Hey, look! My profile includes cute girls, so I'm not a creep!"" So if you can swap it for a better quality picture that serves the same purpose, go for it

**#3** good angle for you, but rest of the picture looks ""dead"", ya know? Like, you're good in it, but consider replacing with something that has better lighting and/or a more lively (or even basic) background

**#4** great, move this to #1, wish the tree branch wasn't blocking the sun on your face, but no big

**#5** great, move this to #2

**#6** ok, it's more of a picture about your interests than you, so #6 is probably a good spot for it. Also Gloomhaven is fuckin' awesome"

Usually u want a clear picture with a nice inviting smile with teeth. Try. Doesn't matter how many takes.

 I see u talk about paying ppl to write your bio and to fix your photos. Then you can better invest in doing a small photoshoot!

,kluv76,1618866910,,Bumble,"You fit my definition of pretty, not my definition of feminine as far as your physical features go.  

I didn't use a trans person looks to belittle you or masculine looks to belittle them. 

 I used your masculine features, along with your wigs to show why guys might ASSUME you are trans and not engage with you. 

This isn't about insults or belittling it's about preference which you yourself mentioned having.  How people feel about dating within the  trans community is much more delicate a subject than how you feel about dating  pretty boys but it's still about an individuals taste.  

As far as ghosting, it comes down to damned if you do and damned if you don't.  For instance if I ask if you're trans and you say yes, well my preference isn't into trans women, no matter how attractive you are.  If I ask and you say no... well, I probably just shot down any chance with you because you'd be upset I thought you looked trans (maybe not you, its just an example)."

I hope my advice is received well- your style of clothing in  these pictures gives a trans vibe, added to the group photos and the fact the second pic is very different makes it look like you're hiding something. I'm sure if you only left the 2nd pic you'd get a lot of matches. Things that do you a disservice- very thick dark lined eyebrows, dark eye shadow, dark suits overall- these hide your good features.. and the wigs are okay, your hair is adorable imo but if you do stick to the wigs maybe try a dark 'natural' one that match your face. pink or bleach blonde again look like a custome and like you're hiding things.

One went nowhere and was going to be weeks worth of texting leading nowhere. The other was when I completely dialed down my standards and got a date, who never showed up. Other than that, it has been maybe 100 or more matches with bots, and one ""35 year old woman"", who appeared to be a 60 year old crossdresser.

Was on Match too. And doesn't seem like too many profiles are actually active. They have a wonderful scam where you can pay extra to allow inactive profiles to be able to respond. Really though, my profile never got views and messages didn't get read.  At one point it just became a game to see if I could get a profile view or a message read. Turns out changing my height to 6'4 actually turned a bunch of messages ""read"", and got my profile viewed.

So basically, fuck that"

She was actually quite pretty, they hit it off and he eventually went to vietnam to get married to her.  He had a huge wedding, lots of fun.

*Then she doesn't want to come back to the USA*... *even though that's what she said before.*

After awhile he finds out it was actually just a long elaborate scam just so he could pay for a huge wedding over there where her entire family was paid to host this wedding.  The gifts, flowers, catering, even the honeymoon: all a way to grift as much money as possible for her and her family.  In fact afterwards the girl admitted that the family kind of pushed her into this elaborate relationship because the family was poor and needed the help.

You can totally meet great people but really keep your eyes open."

An unfiltered picture, taken in natural lighting, is very honest but it's still no guarantee that it will show all flaws and it's not gonna show what a person looks like in nasty fluorescent lighting. 

Most men don't wear makeup/use filters but I am still usually anywhere from surprised to shocked when I see most guys, in person, after first seeing them in photographs.

Sometimes it's obvious that they lied about their height or weight and other times I cannot figure out why I thought they were so attractive, in their pictures, but not attractive in person. Sometimes I just can't figure out what is different; I just don't like it. 

I often wonder if people think I look different, in person. I can't know because I only see myself in mirrors and pictures. Ha"

Guys also don‚Äôt like the whole adventure buddy thing it‚Äôs sounds more like a friendship than a romance. The word buddy can very easily be misinterpreted. Remember people are making split second decisions when using these apps.

Looks wise you‚Äôre average. Honesty is important here to help you succeed not like the girl that commented here saying everything is perfect with your profile and that the guys are intimidated. That‚Äôs a cop out and she is giving you that fake optimism to help you feel better in the moment. I‚Äôm sure what you want is success with online dating and the evidence that something is wrong with your profile comes from the results. The first picture is doing you a disservice.

 third picture, nope that's a man

Fourth picture - yup definitely a man


I read some of your other posts, medical condition - you wear your wigs poorly, bad enough that they actually do you a disservice.  You are dating for someone to like you for you, if a dude can't handle the fact that you have thin/short hair, he's not the one for you."

I mean, whether it‚Äôs height, boob size, abs, ass shape, jaw line, nose type or just how one‚Äôs face looks in general, we are all attracted by physical attributes that are, for the most part, largely beyond the control of their owner. That doesn‚Äôt make you an asshole. It‚Äôs okay to be attracted only to people tall or with big boobs, it‚Äôs just the way it is, you don‚Äôt choose what attracts you.

What‚Äôs stupid is being a dick to people that don‚Äôt attract you, whether it‚Äôs calling them midgets or faties or whatever, but as long as you respectfully states what you are attracted to it should be okay.

Reading the other comments on this thread it seems this guy is just as much an asshole because he enjoys large breasts as he is because he states it in a hicky/tacky/mean way, while the latter should be the only valid reason, just like it‚Äôs fine when a girl says on her bio she is XXX tall and would feed attracted to someone at least as tall as her for instance."

Plus, wigs give a woman the unique (and hot) ability to add more spice to her look, which is always fun!

I don't think mentioning the wig in the profile is necessary at all. It can be disclosed right before meeting in person the first time, after a man gets the pleasure of getting to know your personality through texting and over the phone, or video. Besides, your short hair is clearly in your beach photo.

You have a great smile. Show it in every picture to show off your fun and adventurous side.

Avoid using the word Buddy which can infer being relegated to the dreaded friend zone.

,theunknowngame,1618854481,,Bumble,"Pretty clever joke, do not let this bother you dude. You had done all you could, some girls are just like that. Happens to me all the time, the difference is I get a response once every full moon."

I got ~20% more putting 5'9 (my actual height) than 5'4 and tbh those girls definitely gave a more superficially inclined vibe that I did not like. This did not seem to apply in OK, even in the inverse.

TLDR- filters matter to your total match count, not your meaningful conversations"

The only pics I'd keep are the one with the dog, the bike, and where you're doing that acrobatic move (one-handed handstand?). Ask friends to take some pics of you - or, contact a photographer in your area.

Your ""About me"" is absolutely awful. Seriously, it might be the worst I've ever seen. You make a joke about pedophilia and another one about poop. It will creep/gross out a lot of women. Your prompts aren't as bad but none of them really talk about what makes you unique. For both your ""About me"" and prompts, replace and talk about whatever it is about you that makes you stand out."

This sort of thing happens all the time, especially on OkCupid. Don't allow some random person, who may very well be a dude or some nefarious scammer, to eat up your time.

To me, the biggest red flags are the following: 1. Won't talk on the phone, 2. Won't facetime/zoom, 3. Won't talk about the area you both live, and 4. Won't agree to meetup. As this person is waving all four flags at once I would personally run like hell."

I personally like your natural hare the most, but it sucks for you that you have a medical condition.

I often read here that ppl are a bit opposed the word adventure because it says nothing, you do explain it later so that is fine.

You do say in your bio that you have a lot of wigs, maybe add that it is because of a medical issue? I don't think it should matter, but because I like your natural hair, I thought it was a particular style choice that I could not understand. 

A question like 'Funniest travel story' seems maybe a bit much to type out to a stranger, so maybe keep the question actually a little bit less open ended untill you are in a conversation? That's just what I think if I have to give an answer to that!

,JaronK,1618851625,,Bumble,"There's an interesting binary that people seem to fall in to, with the idea that someone wants you for sex or doesn't.  But in a healthy romantic relationship, people want you for a lot of reasons.  Your personality, your sexuality, your skills, your lifestyle, your sense of humor, all of it.  Sex is one of the many factors involved.  I can tell you that personally when I'm thinking of whether I want to consider someone as a partner, I'm looking at a wide variety of factors, and if any one of them doesn't work I'll back off.  A physically attractive body is one of those factors.  So's her sense of self knowledge.  So's her altruism. So's her humor.  So's her ability to have an actual informed debate where we're both trying to understand each other's points of view.  The fact that I have a partner with a great butt does not change the fact that I love our political debates together... and vice versa.  Her talents as a writer do not change the fact that ""dat booty though"".

In our society, we often teach that women are always desirable... for sex.  Sex sells.  And many women take in that message and think ""I am wanted, but only for my body"".  And often they accidentally reinforce that idea.  If you think the only thing desirable about you is your body, then you will show off your body and nothing else when advertising yourself for a relationship, and in doing so you'll accidentally be signaling that all you have to offer in relationships is sex.  And that can result in men who really would be interested in the rest of you acting sexual quickly towards you, because they really have nothing else to relate to you on, and never even realizing there's something else they'd like about you.  


So, you want to connect with people on more than just sexuality.  Good!  If you want serious relationships, that's very important.  Make a point of trying to connect on those other levels.  It's okay to even say in your profile that you'd like to be friends first.  A lot of guys will jump to sex talk because we're not even sure what else to try to connect on.  If you clearly state your hopes on that point, most of us will follow your cues.  Those that don't, you can drop, because you shouldn't date people who don't match your needs."

,zoomzoom42,1618850121,,Bumble,"People need to temper their expectations with OLD. Just because there is an initial match/attraction it doesn't mean it's a done deal. No different than traditional dating. You may see someone out in a park or a bar. You're interested and start chatting only to discover that the more you talk, the less interested you are.

Its the whole point in dating. The attraction gets you started but the dialog it's what keeps it going....or not."

,ItsJargon,1618849749,,Bumble,"I don't think it'd be the worst thing ever if you were bald, but its easy for our minds to make us think the result will look worse than it really is. I've seen lots of attractive caucasian women without hair (honestly you look like you could pull it off pretty well). Whatever you have, whether it's short hair, no hair, long hair; rock it. 

You'll only get burned if you try to make it look different than it naturally is. Confidence really is key, if you look confident with your hair, guys will be more confident that it's actually pretty hot. If you come out of the gate hiding it, it makes them question it was ever as hot as they thought it was ü§î. 

The sad truth is physical attraction is a big part of Bumble. You only get a few sentences to relate a diverse and intricate personality, so you can't really be judged on your personality. Unless you are looking for specific traits (religion, political stance, etc.) then usually you just judge on looks."

I remembers listening to a NYT story where this mid-age women met a European guy on FB and her son wasn't sure about it, so he requested a video call with the man. In the call, the image was SO blurry and it keeps getting cut off. And they tried to call the number the man provided, and some guy with an Indian accent picked up. In those situation, the next thing they would ask is ""Can you pay for my visa/plane ticket?""

I guess what i wanted to say is, if this is legit, the other party should never have any reason to hide/avoid a video call.

You're either not in online dating either, or your upset at who actually matches you, based on your comment. I think you're overestimating the barrel for men at least. As a male, I can firmly say that the ""good guys"" barely exist. Most of the people who would self-identify as a good guy actually have lots of toxic behaviors and just don't see them for the toxicity that they are. The whole barrel is the bottom.

First, the OP made a move that I can totally understand when being approached in this manner. Being constantly objectified had to wear on you and I can't even imagine being a woman online. It would be exhausting to constantly be asked to be spank bank material for any guy that funds you remotely attractive.

She didn't tell you any of this and has been stringing you along until you felt invested enough that the idea of paying for her to come visit you doesn't seem so crazy. There are some success stories of people meeting this way and also as many or more of people being scammed.

Have you ever had a video call? Do you even know it's a woman you're talking to? And the same woman from the pictures?

Personally I'd run like the wind. I usually arrange a date within a few days of talking, it's a dating app and the point is to date. Chemistry over text is not the same as chemistry in person, you might finally meet them and feel nothing so I don't like to draw the meetings out."

Very much this... although works both ways. 

I have always done very well on dating apps, I wouldn't say I'm that attractive looks wise, maybe a 6 at a push, but I think I'm a decent communicator, know how to construct a decent profile and how to build a conversation that leads to dates.

I'm never on them much past a month before I have found what I was looking for. 

Yet when I do come back on the amount of people you see still on there (and it's fairly easy to tell they never came off), is pretty eye opening and frankly worrying. I suspect there are a number of reasons, but yeah decent people won't hang around long and so dating apps have a fairly high ratio of un-dateable people (in whatever form).

,nearlydeadasababy,1618821869,,Bumble,"How old are you? Makes all the difference in what advice I would give. 

Your expectations are not in any way unrealistic, any decent human being would treat you with respect and take their time getting to know you. My personal way of handling this as a man is to assume sexual talk is off limits until told otherwise, sure you can throw little bit of innuendo out, see what happens but it's really for you both to escalate in an appropriate manner. Nobody on either side should be escalating sexual chat without properly assessing if it is appropriate to do so for the other person. 

Where you expectations might be off is with online dating in general. It is for the most part a cluster fuck... you need to develop slightly thicker skin to deal with (not being negative towards you, it's just a reality). I have always found what I want on dating apps, had a very successful long term relationship and now in another relationship that looks like it will have legs as it were. But you do need to accept that getting to that place might take time and there will be plenty of negative interactions along the way. 

Sadly your concept of all men want is sex is firstly quite wrong (even if a lot do), but online dating isn't going to change your mind on that. The reality is unfortunately that it's for the most part full of people who cannot communicate properly and are actually quite bad at this sort of thine (if they were not then it's unlikely they would be there for long), anybody decent (and I link to consider myself in that) doesn't hang around long and that's been my experience, when I do online dating it's for maybe a month max before I have found something meaningful and moved off again. There are decent people out there, but it takes work and effort to find them. That is where the thick skin comes from, you just need to handle it in the right way mentally. 

I'm not one to suggest therapy to a total stranger (or anyone), but I think you will need to consider how you handle your past relationships and come to terms with the fact not all interactions will be this way. I won't assume how you interact but honestly it's very easy to tell when people put up barriers and you would need to consider this... in many ways those barriers may encourage more of the thing you don't want. 

Good luck."

Bumble is a piece of shit in comparison, because of the time limit and expectation of women to make the first move. It doesn't motivate people to interact with each other more, on the contrary you'll more likely lose the connection because of the limitation and the generally passive approach of women (they're getting more attention elsewhere with less effort), so their original idea falls flat. 

OkCupid is alright and most likely to result in actual conversation, but rarely proceeds any further than online, if you're like me and mostly match with foreigners, like Americans, who are on the other side. But if nothing else, I've gotten gaming friends from there. Tinder's getting me the most local matches, dates and meetings that go beyond online interaction.

While the sarcasm might be considered as obvious to most, what's also obvious was your frustration and disdain for the person you said it to, so at the same time you left yourself open to spiteful retaliation when he caught that. 

This combined with Poe's law gives them the opportunity to make a bad faith report and since the selling/soliciting thing is an ongoing problem (as I mentioned elsewhere certain keywords around it are likely flagged), the app is set up to just shut it down. Is it underhanded? Yup! 100%. That's why the best solution is just to not engage and report them yourself. Leave no openings.

As for whether a live person is fielding and giving a real hard look for every report (stuff like determining whether someone is joking or not) when there are probably thousands to millions to go through, I wouldn't bet on it. They hardly (if ever) reverse bans either, so I don't think they really care to scrutinize as much.  


Question though: Was the word ""nudes"" not flagged? I've heard certain words will be flagged as potentially offensive and asks the person who's matched if they're okay with it. Then the match can decide if it's acceptable to them in the context of the conversation or not."

I have found this to be true with all of my introverted friends and most of my extroverted friends.

Check your descriptions for grammatical errors (e.g. you‚Äôre instead of your, ‚Äòovercome‚Äô obstacles) 

The part where you said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get along if we talk everyday‚Äù sounds more like an expectation/demand, please modify that. The repeated mention of communication and honesty gives me a somewhat needy vibe, that you will easily feel insecure if the girl doesn‚Äôt reply instantly...

,Sailor_Marzipan,1618795796,,Bumble,"you're a good looking fellow, no wonder the lads are liking it! 

My advice:

\-Definitely become 21, that'll be good

\-IMO your first two photos are a little too ""tough guy"" compared to the more sensitive side the other photos reveal? I would at least try moving those photos back and using a smiling or instrument photo.

\-I don't feel like I really know that much about you from your profile except for hobbies. Hobbies are a good way to connect, but they're not your entire personality. Having a vaccination, going for rides, picking a place to eat... all nice but all vague and a little too safe.

\-I think the ""perfect first date"" prompt is a bit of a missed opportunity. Grabbing coffee and seeing how it goes is... very basic. Everyone your age is likely meeting for coffee because you can't legally drink :') you could've used this space to maybe reveal a bit more about yourself or what someone can expect from dating you. I would add in another prompt and try to dig deeper when it comes to your personality beyond hobbies/school/date locations.

\-I personally don't think it's wise to put ""I don't know yet"" on Bumble because it reduces the # of people swiping on you from either direction (if they know what they want). And if people use the filters to find ""people interested in relationships"" or whatever, they won't even come across your profile (and I think women use filters more than men). I would just go with whatever feels MORE right and see how you fare."

Those who do message may message just a handful of times and then never message again, despite my efforts to carry a conversation.

That's discouraging and it then makes me feel like not putting in effort. I'd say OLD can create a cycle of cynicism where people continue to get discouraged and put in less and less effort as a result.

I also hear that men tend to swipe right more than women and so I suppose that also leads to them putting in less effort with the matches they get. They're focusing more on quantity than quality and consequently the quality of conversation also suffers, perhaps.

Just my thoughts.

I will confess, in my earlier days of OLD, I was bad at being the one to just stop messaging back or unmatching instead of at least sending a message to say I was not really interested anymore. So I sadly contributed, and still occasionally do, to this cycle of cynicism. üòî"

Not woman friendly? Bumble shouldn't be an app to request free nudes/OF access/etc and completely get away with it.

\*bingo\*  

Reddit as a whole is filled with these guys. They are in every relationship advice with their throw away accounts trying to gaslight and confuse women more. All I see are posts from confused women about obvious abuse and men complaining about height while shitting on fat women in the process, and their entitlement to a woman's body. and then there's a small sect of ninja incels that sneak into posts about women and drop their misogynistic propaganda telling women to avoid certain subreddits to keep us confused.

All I can say is, take things with a grain of salt and know that there's bad people pretending to be good trying to steer you closer to a dumpster fire lifestyle than a healthy one."

When I respond with ""Hi"", I'll be honest, I'm not that interested or the guy didn't give me much to work with on his bio. When I do that though, the conversations become dry and one of us ghost each other.

That was rhetorical; I don‚Äôt want to know, and I can‚Äôt imagine you matches want to know until months down the road when you‚Äôre in a committed relationship together. THAT is when open communication hits its prime. In dating, that stuff is at best boring and at worst an attempt to manipulate and love bomb people into vulnerability.

Scrap it all except the exercise part. That‚Äôs cool. Talk about the fun and activity that goes on in your life which you can share with a date. Remember that‚Äôs what your sales pitch is for: fun dates. Being worth someone‚Äôs time and company, if they‚Äôre worth yours...not what you have going on there.

PS: photos are so people can see what you look like and you‚Äôre hidden behind a mask in two...don‚Äôt do that. Also, do you have friends with whom you spend time and have photos taken of you?

Anyway, I used to read carefully all profiles and check carefully the pictures when I started using dating apps. After sometime, I lost the patience I had and now it takes me 1 second to decide for like or dislike and it's solely based on the profile picture.

Then when I get a match I check everything carefully before replying and if the girl doesn't interest me, I don't answer.

I‚Äôve matched with girls that will send a generic ass message and then not respond anymore.

,berpyderpderp2ne1,1618781437,,Bumble,"I really like your bio/question responses. I think you need to work on your pictures. 

1. Your profile picture clashes w your description of being a fedex driver. I think it's great that you recently graduated/are proud of your achievement--but either strike the fedex line from your bio or change your profile pic to a close-up. 

2. The pic of you w the driver (i'm guessing) is nice, but be warned of pictures with other men bc what you do is set yourself up to be physically compared to the other person. I'd swap it out with a different group pic, if at all possible. 

3. Stay away from mirror pics at all costs. They're generally unflattering and will bunch you in w all the other guys that post mirror pics (a lot), getting you quick swipes left. If you want more matches, try to get more pics of you out and about/doing things/looking nice.

I'd actually recommend going more extreme with your two truths/one lie. All three sound like the truth, which is the point of the game, but they're a little blas√©. 

What would help your profile stand out would be to evoke a reaction here that'll get ppl to swipe right/start a convo. E.g. something like *""I've never been pegged before""* or *""i was attacked by an alpaca in peru.""* &lt;--maybe not the pegging one, lol--but you get the point.

,redi20,1618780622,,Bumble,"Yes, I sensed that and there's certainly a lot of enjoyment having a cerebral to cerebral connection with a woman. It can be very hot. But, leave those questions and that assessment until later.

The following will get deep very fast:

There is a concept of connecting first to a woman's feeling, her soul, gut, femininity, goddess, romance, vulnerability (there's more too since women have gorgeous spectrum).

And, then there's connecting to a woman's brain ala a cerebral to cerebral connection. It's super easy to do this with an Alpha Woman who thinks first and feels second (just like a man who leads with masculine energy).

Do what you like, but recognize that most women want a man to connect to their feminine energy.  The peril of a brain to brain (masculine energy to masculine energy) connection is that ultimately, often years down the road, it will exhaust a woman and cause her to build resentment because she discovers her femininity hasn't been fed, and she WILL find a way to get it fed, which will require the man to adapt quickly (quite unfamiliarly), live unhappily together or get divorced.

Yes, of course, this doesn't apply to everyone and there are differences in how it applies, but for the vast majority of people it does.

There are all kinds of books and articles about masculine and feminine energy. As a smart guy, you may enjoy the power of gaining this knowledge."

For a thousand different reasons. Humans are complicated and many have busy lives. You are two strangers on an app. There should be zero expectation of social decency or reliability in communication.

,Current-Ticket4214,1618780475,,Bumble,You still gave him a C tho
,berpyderpderp2ne1,1618780343,,Bumble,"There's some room for improvement. 

1. Your profile pic isn't very good. Yeah, you listed that you're 18, but there's no reason to be advertising it. It makes you seem really young. (Unless you're doing that for comedic purposes or something). I'd suggest a close-up of you smiling instead.  

2. I'd remove  ""I'm free saturday night"" from your bio because it sounds like you're saying that to every girl (i.e. a bit desperate). 

3. I like your cheezit line, but I think you could make it funnier. Consider: *""I got two kraft mac [etc etc...] and exactly 16 cheezits to my name.""* Followed by a line prompting feedback about that (maybe something along the lines of hbu but not literally ""hbu""). (Remove the part about running out). Point being that the goal w your bio/question responses is to get someone intrigued enough to swipe right and initiate a convo about x/y/z. 

4. I'd swap out the group pic w another. It looks really fun, but there are way too many people to pick you out quickly. My eyes went to the guy on the right first instead of you. Also note that group pics w guys will have viewers comparing you to the guys in degrees of attractiveness, while ones w girls will have ppl wondering if theyre you're gf/ex, even if theyre not. So, try to find a group pic where you're obviously the center of attention/the life of the party. 

5. I've seen the question response about the word ""epitome"" quite a few times now, so I'd recommend changing that question or response to something more original. 

The rest of your profile looks ok. This may seem like a lot of feedback, but if you're trying to beat the crowd you gotta spice up your profile early on. Best of luck to ya!"

,Inconspicuous_0100,1618779948,,Bumble,"It comes down to your level of comfort and risk tolerance, OP. It's tough to give you a definitive answer one way or the other because it comes down to a lot of personal beliefs on your end.

That being said, I generally err on the side of caution whenever communicating with a stranger over a dating/hookup platform. Personally I don't send nudes/shirtless pics/dick pics etc. because I'd rather form a more genuine connection over the phone and in-person first, and it kills the vibe for me. But if you're strictly looking for a hookup then maybe you're more comfortable with sending pics back and forth. Once you confirm the person is real, you've eliminated a portion of the risk associated with communicating via pictures/videos but this person is *still a stranger.*

It ultimately comes down to why you would be afraid of someone blackmailing you over one shirtless picture. Are you more afraid of being catfished or ghosted here? Are you afraid she only wants a hookup? Afraid she won't like you? The easiest way to avoid these questions is to find a principled stance one way or the other and roll with it with every match. If you're okay with sending shirtless pictures to someone over a dating app (even if they're 100% real) you're still incurring the risk of her not responding, ghosting, or using it for more nefarious purposes."

I personally never opened w that, so I can understand guys' frustrations when they constantly come across it and why you would feel the need to pre-filter those ppl out.

I get some very hot matches on tinder (especially when i boost i got a lot, though admittedly most were not in my area and were using the passport mode, also weird).

I'm 25M, and every app I've been on has been a horrific experience. Lazy opening messages, absolutely no effort whatsoever into conversations, and it just repeats over and over.
Maybe one out of 100 matches turns out even somewhat decent? 
Sorry you're just discovering it, but yeah, these apps are a void for everyone except super models."
,Rich-12-88,1618771464,,Bumble,"We‚Äôve discussed this before, yes all of these app have deceptive practices to entice you to spend. Tinder (as I‚Äôve said before I was a match shareholder from IPO until last year) is definitely a bad actor and one day the government will look into these platforms, but right now it‚Äôs the Wild West. They will hide matches until you buy a boost or something of the sort, will overstate matches, and will show your profile outside of your criteria to entice matches and spending to find out you need to left swipe them all. So, yes, if you think you‚Äôre getting screwed, you probably are. If you think you‚Äôll do just as well being a free member, you wont, etc. But if you were to pay to see your beeline, I‚Äôve heard of some profiles being hidden until you pay (or at least held back for longer), but you‚Äôll probably see a bunch of desperate women that they showed your profile to no matter how far (well I mean not 1,000 miles but way outside of your criteria) that they identified as chronic right swipers to show a profile to in order to show some likes. As for being completely wrong, not sure about that, but you‚Äôd probably be disappointed with what you found. Remember these apps aren‚Äôt to get you laid or married, that‚Äôs what they tell stupid people, they have one purpose and one purpose alone: To suck money out of your pocket. Obviously they allow free users to keep the user base up, just like ladies night, ladies get in free because everyone that chases them will make them tons of money."
,Therocksays2020,1618771455,,Bumble,Bumble works just fine for me so maybe your profile just sucks and isn‚Äôt appealing. Lots of women here say they don‚Äôt swipe right on low effort profiles. Tinder on the other hand is more of a hot or not deal.

I lost a lot of the friends I had built up and really went into the habits I had in early middle and high school, because talking to people in person drained her. Extroverts for me are more my speed because I get to go out and do the fun stuff while not having to worry about whether or not I‚Äôm going to be able to keep a steady conversation. I‚Äôm like my grandad, whose introverted, and my grandma was super extroverted and loved keeping conversation, so having someone that can do that for me and who I can show love and affection for in return is really my kind of person.

I had some guy tell me his dad died.  I felt for him and he started probing whether I‚Äôm interested in relationships or friends (but his idea of friends was FWB).  Then I realized he likes to rush his dating and started asking questions on how to date.  He was not impressed when I told him it‚Äôs better for him to talk to a therapist because I‚Äôm not here for him to emotional dump on because that‚Äôs abusive.

,AFB27,1618765460,,Bumble,"Online dating, I mean just dating in general, is a game of volume, it's all about finding that needle in a haystack. We don't have algorithms on our side to optimize who we match with, so the only thing we can really count on is appearance, because that's practically ""first impression""

You win some, you lose some. It's better to give effort, not receive any back, and move on, rather than half assing it all the time and pushing someone away who might be worth the time. This is a game of perseverance and consistency"

I matched with a girl a while ago and the conversation was so natural and fluid, it was  refreshing. I think you can get an idea if you will click with someone quite early on in messages.

As a cinephile, my favourite question is to ask someone their top five movies. I think you can get a good feel for someones vibe from that. Also, if they reply with 'I don't really watch films' I'm outta there!

I'm in a different age group but it still goes on. I swipe left on about 97 percent of the guys out there. That's from my Beeline and main feed. There is something to be said for meeting someone who runs in the same circles, with similar interests and lifestyles. It's been hard to get out there for a lot of us d/t COVID and for me, living transiently. As things slowly get better I think that's the direction I'm going to take.

I‚Äôve tried to subtly hint at that in my profile about structure of conversation, hoping that one person might read it...no, that was a foolish pursuit. 

I think it‚Äôs a few things, either people generally don‚Äôt know how to maintain a conversation, aren‚Äôt really interested in the other person, or just simply conceded. You may just have to move on form those people.

First of all, I think what I‚Äôm going to say is somewhat unique to me because of where I live and my preferences. I live in California in a pretty urban area. My type is a busy person who is sure of themselves and who they are- super in tune. I prefer people who have goals that come from having passions rather than following goals they feel like they have to achieve. 


For lack of a better word, people here don‚Äôt feel genuine. It‚Äôs not a totally bad thing, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre trying to be fake. But most of the people I‚Äôve met off dating apps don‚Äôt seem sure of themselves, they seem like they‚Äôre doing what they think they‚Äôre supposed to be doing. They don‚Äôt seem as mature emotionally as I‚Äôd like. There‚Äôs too much game playing and not enough transparency with their intentions and desires. It feels like they‚Äôre afraid to put those out so they put on a front. 
There‚Äôs also this weird vibe with a lot of the guys here. I love a guy with confidence, but everyone my age (18-26) seems to have this weird narcissism. It‚Äôs not always super big, or bad, but it feels like it‚Äôs in place of a natural, healthy self love. The people I meet naturally, who aren‚Äôt on dating apps and don‚Äôt use social media a lot just feel different. I don‚Äôt mean to be on a high horse by saying that, it‚Äôs just my experience.

I don't think it matters - meet early...meet after a few days...meet after a month.  Personally, I'd rather meet early.  It's all about your two personalities ""clicking"" in person.  You can have a great text or message relationship, but a horrible in person experience."
,TeeDubbleDee,1618754385,,Bumble,"It's weird hearing the same issues I'm having coming from the other side. 25M myself. 

From what you're saying, the only problem just seems to be giving energy to people that don't deserve it. Rule of thumb, if by the third or fourth message they're still giving dry replies, just unmatch. No sense stressing over it. 

You're doing what you should be. Keeping the conversation afloat, charming introductions.. Just keep doing you, and you'll find someone that does the same, or at least that's what the preteen emo music I listen to tells me. 

I wish you all the best luck!"
,jchrysostom,1618754121,,Bumble,"Agreed, would swipe right.

What attitude? Quote exactly what I said and what attitude it pertains to.

That same someone who said that has apologised and realised there was no ‚Äòattitude‚Äô. 
I didn‚Äôt say I was owed special treatment, you‚Äôve made that up completely.

What you‚Äôve done here is interpret what I‚Äôve said through your negative goggles, and made a bunch of assumptions that are completely false. You‚Äôre now arguing a point that‚Äôs irrelevant to the post. Look at the actual question and what I‚Äôve said."
,artichokess,1618752942,,Bumble,"You both could do better. Grey isn't being generous with their responses. You aren't being tactful.

And it's completely relevant, considering it's the exact same attitude but with the roles reversed. The fact that you don't like to hear the truth it's another business.

As someone already said, stop having this ""oh I'm so important"" attitude, you're not the last Coke in the desert, you're just a random stranger on a dating app. No one owes you special treatment at that stage. After a while, if you're trying to keep the conversation going and ask questions it's ok to complain if the other person does not make the same effort, yeah, sure. But at that initial stage you're a complete stranger, and the person on the other side is, too. Complete strangers don't owe you some kind of special treatment just because you've swiped right on them."

,HuckleberryThis2012,1618752532,,Bumble,"Yeah you can always sort of feel it when the conversation is going well, I find that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs just random nonsense and not just and exchange of information about each other, and asking for their number feels natural. It is also odd, I think at least, to ask for a date when you haven‚Äôt exchanged numbers."
,fntastk,1618752434,,Bumble,"Yeah, without the pandemic I'd consider it maybe the next day, but the world has changed a lot. I'm almost fully vaccinated so hopefully I can begin going out a little more. We all have been so sheltered the last year."

,HuckleberryThis2012,1618751519,,Bumble,"Yeah if they‚Äôre messaging you they‚Äôre interested at least on some level. Many ppl have stories of matches expiring without receiving a message. I would just roll with and assume they‚Äôre just sort of awkward and don‚Äôt know what to say. That and they don‚Äôt typically have to say more than ‚ÄúHi‚Äù so they probably haven‚Äôt been crafting good responses often enough to become skilled at it the way guys have to be. If you‚Äôre on tinder saying hi you‚Äôre prob getting minimal responses. So you had to develop the ability to think of something unique and interesting. It‚Äôs just sort of the fall out for how dating is typically started by guys. 

Plus like I said before, if she turns out to be not interested and you let the match go, you‚Äôve really lost nothing. So you only have something to gain and nothing to lose by trying to get a convo going. I know it‚Äôs annoying, but gotta push through."

Yeh, the common response here seems to be to respond and gauge if she‚Äôs not interest later. Noted.

,HuckleberryThis2012,1618750729,,Bumble,"I wouldn‚Äôt suggest trying to ‚Äútone yourself down‚Äù at all. You don‚Äôt want to get into a situation where you‚Äôve hidden who you are, and when you finally show it they are shocked or they want out. You gotta learn to accept that with all of the additional options online dating gives you, comes a bunch of dates with ppl you won‚Äôt really click with (or you won‚Äôt click for them) 

It‚Äôs mot anything wrong with you, or anything you‚Äôre doing wrong. Sometimes ppl just aren‚Äôt into each other, and that‚Äôs going to be the far bigger % than someone who will be super into you. Not to be that guy, but are you kissing these guys or anything more? Sometimes for us we think if there‚Äôs no physical stuff at all that the girl isn‚Äôt into us, or that maybe they just don‚Äôt like taking it slow. Not that you should ever do something you‚Äôre not comfortable with, or be pressured into anything ever, bc you shouldn‚Äôt. But there are plenty of guys who just don‚Äôt care to wait, or maybe they‚Äôre talking to and hanging out with girls who do show more physical affection and they find that‚Äôs what they like. You just gotta be upfront about everything including who you are as a person and keep putting the effort in until someone comes along that is into you. 

All that said, maybe try to ask them questions about what they like and try to talk about that. Guys like girls who talk a lot, just jot when they talk about stuff we don‚Äôt have any interest in. Guys are also super unused to compliments and girls taking interest in our interests. If you do that you will def stand out."
,nothingspecialcrisis,1618750659,,Bumble,"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre fictitious, but it does sound like it‚Äôs been buggy for a lot of folks. You said yourself that your count changes as you swipe past some of the people on your beeline."
,lemurianelf,1618750484,,Bumble,"Apart from the other commenter said, it's no one job to help you overcome  it. People have their own problems and lives. Us women would obviously rather date normal sane men than angry women haters nor helping them and ending up shot or raped or worse as a result.

,Jonnysaliva,1618750400,,Bumble,No kidding. If the do the minimum regarding possibly finding someone to share their most intimate moments with etc etc imagine how they treat things that aren‚Äôt I Important at all. Haha it‚Äôs really a win win. They show their true colors early. Thank god.
,HuckleberryThis2012,1618750208,,Bumble,"No, most girls say hi or send a gif. Not being good at starting a convo (remember girls are almost never the ones to initiate that stuff in real life and so many haven‚Äôt developed that conversation starting skill). That in NO way is indicative of a girls personality or if they‚Äôre a good person or good potential gf. Don‚Äôt have this attitude that you‚Äôre so important that girls need to blow your mind with a super interesting opener. Respond and see if the conversation goes anywhere. If she‚Äôs boring the convo will be boring and you can end it then. No reason to cut someone off for not being the best first line creator in the world."
,Kalium,1618750103,,Bumble,"You're absolutely right - most guys become slightly better looking with good photography!

Unfortunately, in the world of online dating a 10 is a 10 and an 8 is a 2. The number of men who are going to jump from below average to slightly above average to *fucking stunning* with better photography is so small as to not be worth the time to discuss.

Again, you're completely correct. Quality photography is important! It's just perhaps worth considering that it might be less influential than a well-meant observer might guess."
,RobotDevil222x3,1618750099,,Bumble,Whether or not someone is christian and whether or not they are looking for hookups are not related to each other.

Online dating is great for having more potential ppl to meet, but it‚Äôs also a nightmare bc now everyone feels like they don‚Äôt need to out in effort bc there‚Äôs always more options. They think it‚Äôs now on other ppl to impress THEM, and they‚Äôre suddenly the prize or some sort of playa they never had the nerve to be when you had to go up to strangers in public before online dating."

,Kalium,1618749941,,Bumble,"&gt; What does everyone think here?

A lot of men, including myself, have had the experience that every time the conversation is paused or the app is closed, there's a very real chance the conversation has died forever.

With that in mind, I would venture to guess he's trying things to get past that. Meeting up quickly is, as you say, *absolutely* a cause for concern during a pandemic.

If you want to text with him for a few days first, perhaps consider telling him so and offering something a little more substantial than Bumble chat to show you mean it."
,HuckleberryThis2012,1618749930,,Bumble,"I think bc girls get so many more matches per swipe than we do, that they don‚Äôt want to have that many convos and sometimes you get left behind bc of the time limit to message. It‚Äôs the big downside of bumble, that you have no control and no way to make yourself stand out with a good conversation starter. Lol it‚Äôs meant for girls to have control and avoid some of the creeps, but then girls seem to all (not all but yeah almost all) just say ‚Äúhey‚Äù or send a gif"
,HuckleberryThis2012,1618749777,,Bumble,"Haha it always blows my mind that a guy would join bumble and have to wait for a girl to message first, just so they can blow their chances by saying shit like that."
,HuckleberryThis2012,1618749637,,Bumble,"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äútoo fast‚Äù at all. What if you send 1-2 messages a day back and forth for two weeks? You‚Äôve sent maybe 28 messages and might think that‚Äôs comfortable enough to hang out. Now what if you message all day and he asks you out after 40+ messages? Is it too soon bc it‚Äôs only one day? 

What if you send a bunch of interview style ‚Äúwhat do you do for fun? What do you do for work‚Äù questions that aren‚Äôt really indicative of if you would get along? Is that enough compared to having a real flowing back and forth banter with fewer messages? 

My point being that it‚Äôs not about how many messages you sent, or how long it took to send that many messages. It‚Äôs about how comfortable you feel with each other, and if you are feeling like it‚Äôs too soon, then it‚Äôs prob too soon. If you agree to the date you might feel uncomfortable going in, and that‚Äôs gonna hurt your chances of having a good date. Tell him you want to exchange numbers first and talk more. Or if you make plans push it out a week or two and talk in the time leading up to it. That way if he doesn‚Äôt keep in touch you can cancel the plans."

,Kabidon,1618749340,,Bumble,"They do, there‚Äôs no debate to be had on that.

People have differing standards. I would like to determine whether there is interest early, and you may be fine with someone who isn‚Äôt truly interested, to each their own.

,HuckleberryThis2012,1618748802,,Bumble,"You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong, some ppl just are boring as shit and it‚Äôs good to weed them out up front. You‚Äôre old enough, sorry lol, to remember having to hit on ppl at bars, so you should realize that it‚Äôs a newer thing to have this many options. This makes ppl lazy in regards to how much effort they need to put it. When you had to go build the courage to approach a girl in public, hope there was one at the exact location as you you find attractive, hope that she is single and open to being hit on, and that her friends aren‚Äôt going to shut it down bc they aren‚Äôt being hit on, the sheer amount of effort that took made both parties more willing to try to push through any early on awkwardness or missteps. Now everyone has this attitude of ‚ÄúI have all of these options so YOU need to make ME feel interested enough to stay talking to you. 

It also has all of these guys who never had the nerve, or skill, to pick up a girl in public think they‚Äôre all of a sudden some slick pimp. And that‚Äôs not helpful for women online and why they get a slew of idiotic repetitive pick up lines and unsolicited dick pics"

It feels hurt in opposite side though.

Just keep your chin up, I hope you will find the one who suitable for you:)"

So let's run with it? Let's take this SERIOUSLY... This is supposed to be LOVE! Let's go get a coffee and see if we could have, possibly, ""most likely not but damn I'm still gonna hope"" just met the love of our life?

I think it shows passion and trust when two people are excited and willing to meet that way... That QUICKLY. They're willing to give it a real chance!

,fireman-zac,1618718954,,Bumble,"Like a lot of people have said already, you should always respond (assuming you‚Äôre at least surface level interested in this person) because you never know what could come of it. I‚Äôve gone on dates with girls who have started the conversation with a wave that went well. But take it as a bit of a yellow flag (not red necessarily) and don‚Äôt be surprised if they aren‚Äôt interested in you. It‚Äôs low effort for sure, but you never know."
,krmaml,1618718616,,Bumble,Good luck having girls to admit that. They literally beleive no guy is above their league
,AvocadoTst,1618718515,,Bumble,"You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. I really think it‚Äôs pandemic fatigue and apathy. 

I was last on bumble about three years ago (42-43 at that time) and honestly I couldn‚Äôt keep up with it. I went on dates with so many great guys before I met my ex (thought he was the one, but that‚Äôs another story). I was going on five dates a week and could‚Äôve gone on more if I wanted. Nice guys, handsome guys, interesting people from all walks of life. I made some great friends out of it too. 

I‚Äôm experiencing what you‚Äôre describing - the vibe is just dramatically different this time around. I haven‚Äôt changed that much so I have to put it down to the state of the world - it‚Äôs just a really different energy. I really wouldn‚Äôt take it personally, I‚Äôve decided not to."

,Jackson530,1618717747,,Bumble,It cannot be!
,krmaml,1618717495,,Bumble,"Good luck having girls acknowledge this. In their world there are no leagues (that apply to them anyway) and any girl no matter how ordinary/mediocre looking can get any model or local hearththrob. Girls are never encouraged to think along these lines and only told to ""follow their dreams"" or something. You can't blame them fully for this. Guys have much lower standards for casual sex and hookups so would talk to, flirt with, respond favorably to literally any girl, causing girls to overestimate their league"
,AvocadoTst,1618717351,,Bumble,"They didn‚Äôt - I had a couple recent ones at the top of my beeline which were wiped out as well. I never even thought about it but you‚Äôre right, they can‚Äôt have done that on purpose. I think Bumble fucked up big time."

,EnvironmentalExcuse0,1618716319,,Bumble,"Also, it really messes with your self worth. Peoples standards are so skewed on dating apps that people may view you as a second choice. I find the people I meet naturally view me as their first choice or actually feel lucky to have me in their life. I don‚Äôt mean that in a conceited way, but people you‚Äôre romantically involved with should feel that way. You shouldn‚Äôt be with someone who‚Äôs just ‚Äúeh‚Äù about you."

,EnvironmentalExcuse0,1618716164,,Bumble,"Honestly, I thought this was an exaggeration, but after 5 years and a bunch of dates I‚Äôve realized how right my friends were when they said no one you want to meet is going to be on dating apps. Maybe 1 or 2, but it‚Äôs not likely. You‚Äôre not going to meet the kind of people you want to meet on there. That‚Äôs not to say anything bad about having a dating app, just the people who happen to be on there aren‚Äôt the best. I‚Äôve found much more luck with throwing myself into my community and doing things I like and joining groups or volunteering. Then you find your people and inevitably find someone who likes you.

So I figured this is clearer, but noone has ever misunderstood like this"
,OkAnywhere0,1618715407,,Bumble,"I'm also a ""hi""er. There's a few different reasons for it: a) there's nothing in the profile for me to grab onto b) bumble only gives you 24 hours to send a message before the match expires and I don't always have the energy to come up with something creative in that timeframe, and c) Lots of men don't respond even when I've put the effort in for a curated opener, so I'd rather wait to see if they'll respond first before digging in.

,AirSpacer,1618713433,,Bumble,"Not to take sides here but your approach was very direct. A simple ‚Äúwhere are you from?‚Äù would have sufficed.

,katdanmorgan,1618713222,,Bumble,"I‚Äôm a female, so take this with a grain of salt if you want to! 

I definitely think that on Bumble, when the roles are reversed, a lot of women don‚Äôt necessarily know how to start conversations. What I think is happening is that they still have those expectations of ‚Äúa man must hit on me but since I have to start the conversation, I‚Äôll let him carry it‚Äù or it‚Äôs possible that they‚Äôve never been in a situation where they have to be the ones to actually start it, so it ends up with them kind of being half-assed about it. I think that if you want to respond, then you have to treat them how you want to be treated (annoying, I know since they‚Äôre being lackluster). if that means going ‚Äúoh hey,____, how‚Äôs your weekend looking?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhey, _____, tell me about the band on your shirt in this photo‚Äù then you should do it.

,Skellyton5,1618705260,,Bumble,"I had no luck on hinge also. I've tried plenty of dating apps and I find bumble to be the best, at least of you're looking for a wife candidate. I can't speak for those wanting hookups though.

In my experience it's harder to get girls to match than it is to get dates. Once you get em in the door really all you have to do is keep the conversation flowing then eventually ask them out. 

If you're sending messages back and forth throughout the day, day after day, she's Into you. It's really that simple. If she's sending you good morning texts, she's very into you. 

It's no coincidence that I'm successful on bumble. I never had a gf in highschool and multiple times I failed a new years resolution to get laid. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the term, but I did my best to MinMax on bumble. Did a bunch of research on what works and what doesn't etc etc. It paid off. 

Here's a few tips, it would take quite awhile to write out all the tips and tricks I use. 

- Unless She's the one who initiates, never ever text your match while turned on. Close the app, rub it out, and then go back to messaging. Just trust me on this one.

- Your profile pic matters more than everything else in your profile put together times 2. There's plenty of resources on google on how to get the best profile pic.

- You gotta have a good reservoir of questions, especially those that prompt her to talk about herself. Ask about her goals, her hobbies etc. The most powerful question you can ask is ""What are you passionate about?"". I usually save this as a lifeline in case the conversation starts dying. Walls of text are a good sign. If your getting single line answers and she's not asking you the same question back that's a bad sign. If you feel you are the only one driving the conversation then she's either not really interested or not a quality woman."

My question is... what location does Bumble use then? If it's no longer in my phone, it no longer has access to its location, so which one does it use? Perhaps the last location before the uninstall? And that means I don't have to constantly stay in Italy until I get a match and instead spoof into Italy once, open up Bumble and let it sync with the location, then delete Bumble, then come back to my country and delete the location spoofer as well? Just an idea though.

,OompaLoompaO,1618692224,,Bumble,"yeah i checked out OPs previous posts. the part thats confusing is a woman that makes a profile and leaves the bio blank minus putting the height. which is something men do.

Conversations tips: if the girl has info or an interest have that question reflect that. It won‚Äôt always work but if a girl likes you and it‚Äôs a fun topic that can start a conversation, go for it. Then remember it all depends how fast the convo and flow is, but don‚Äôt go beyond like three topics without setting up a time and place date. 

If she likes you then she will accept and offer a day that works for both. Its more work for guys but dates will appreciate a dude who can setup a date with details. Nothing big, find a place close by to your date, maybe share a plate of fries/pizza and drinks, keep it casual and easy for both parties. If you guys hit it off on the date then you can setup a date with an activity or something."

Asking someone to say a random thing about themselves is like asking someone to say something in a foreign language. It‚Äôs can be awkward.

I get lots of matches but the conversations are like pulling teeth. Slow responses, matches expiring, can‚Äôt seem to get someone to meet up for a quick coffee, etc.

,AWitchsTit,1618686879,,Bumble,"I saw this response from someone a few months back: speak on your profile to the type/quality of person you're trying to attract. 

Don't put negative remarks on there. Think about what qualities make you unique--do you like hiking, collect unusual trinkets, are you passionate about something?

Make sure you have some pictures with you genuinely smiling--not forced, or fake-looking--and keep the group photos to a minimum."
,ArtfulThoughts,1618686869,,Bumble,"Don‚Äôt be negative. Some men write about ex‚Äôs, that they hate shallow people, they get messed around on the app. It feels like they‚Äôre already moaning at you and strangers moaning at you is weird. However, you can talk about your dislikes, if they‚Äôre weird they could be a nice talking point. 

Any pictures of you doing something you‚Äôd like to do with a partner - it‚Äôs easier for us to imagine what it would be like spending time with you (another reason the fish pictures are a turn off). 

Do, tell us what qualities you look for in a woman and what you think are your best qualities.

If this was a woman she would of put her weight, something every man wants to know because a lot of men dont want to date fat woman.  

 Next, look at the top of the screenshot. You see ""Yesterday""? That denotes that there was a previous conversation there. Why would bumble put ""Yeaterday"" at the top and beginning of a conversation that just started. So clearly the OP, a woman, cropped the screenshot to get to the best part."

That's not Bumble's problem or any dating app's. It's called the internet, people can fake their location, their gender, their looks, their personality, their nationality, what they own, their basically entire identity... it's not the first time. Have you heard of someone blaming dating apps that catfish happens? Even if you did sometimes, that would be a useless thing to do.

Also PS: I actually tell in my profile that I'm from Armenia, so I'm not sure if I'm faking my location publicly. There's nothing unfair there.

&gt;But you don't care because it relieves your boredom.

I care about finding someone, just like anybody using a dating app does. I doubt I don't have the right to choose in what region I want to look for someone.

Refer to line 4. 

Obviously you can't blanket a whole sex, doesn't mean women can't be raised right from the jump or can't learn from being used only once to understand what they want long term. We're talking about the majority here, again.. we've got the data now to show the typical trajectory of the typical woman. Personally, I'm glad you were level headed all the way through but let me offer you this.. Did you grow into puberty and your teens with IG/TT/OF? 

Bring a child to Walmart, tell em to pick out candy and hand em 3 quarters. It's easy to pick from 3 maybe 4 MAX. Now bring them back the next day and hand them 3 Benjamins. Just. Imagine. üôåüèº  Again, not every child will break every benjamin but they'll certainly be tempted.. and why would they go for the cheap chocolate when they have enough for the good stuff?

I get that the main rules haven't changed for growing up but we ain't gonna act like social media hasn't had it's prominent effect for both sides. A young woman right now, doesn't even have to have a model body or face, is capable of conjuring attention left and right. Back in the 90's you basically had your school district to choose potential love interests from until college, this new open market has offered young women the ability to connect with guys from literally anywhere. So not only has the market opened to it's limit but make up/skin care have also advanced 10x, toss in all the countless marketing to women like those tiktok leggings to make em sexier..etc 

Women are already shown to swipe for guys 3-7 years older, these older men are simply more established. This is the quality chocolate. These are also the guys you would've come across 10x LESS back in the 90's. This isn't about shaming women, it's about understanding them...

,computerlovepodcast,1618685580,,Bumble,"This is impossible to answer without seeing your profile, stats and pictures. But I will give you my best answer based off the results you said you are having.

Bumble is a site where the woman has to make the first move. 

If you are matching with men, contacting them, and then receiving very little interest.  Then it is 95% likely that its because of your pictures and stats, 5% because of what you wrote in your bio.

You didn't have a chance to do anything wrong yet.

The only error you made is going after men that are not looking for a woman like yourself. 

And that is ok, you don't want a man who is not looking for you.

If this sounds mean, I'm sorry but these are the simple fact. 

There just isn't enough info for it to be anything else. 

If you were, highly attractive, great bio and stats. A man would respond to you with much enthusiasm. Since this is not happening then you just have to do the math.

Hope that makes sense and sorry I can't be of more help, but all I know is what you shared.

I‚Äôve read your back and forth with the another person and I disagree with you completely. The person who started the convo should have continued it. A normal convo would have been:

Her: Hello
Him: Hi, Person! 
Her: How‚Äôs your day going? What are you up too? 
Or whatever... 

He turned me off personally with his next comment of ‚Äú Not much in your profile.

Just so you know, sex can pretty much be vital for your mental health as well if you sre a straight sexual person. I personally have to go to escorts from time to time just to lower down my depression because, well, women are not attracted to me so I have to pay for sex. I am a very sexual person and I need sex to stay sane and think normal. Some people's brains work like that and you do not have to understand it or judge it.

Women CANNOT or WILL NOT tell you.

Bro, you have to understand that women want different things in men as time goes on. Young women are currently encouraged to have frivolous fun, once they're done they look for another kind of man. If you believe when women tell you to be nice and respectful that they're talking about the first half of their sexual experience.. ü§£üòÇü§£  no.

GRANTED this isn't ALL women but the statistics on these dating apps back up what men already expected decades ago, they will date up with more established men. So if you actually WANT a good shot at having the same amount of innocent fun as the modern young chick then you need to establish what grabs their attention the most and this is Looks &amp; Status. 

Hopefully you spent all that alone time building up muscle, dominant traits, and a career so that you can now invest the time to build a proper profile with 3-5 pics, all diff outfits &amp; diff places taken by a PROFESSIONAL. Don't forget to photoshop/touch em up. If you need 3 inches to get to 6ft then by all means put socks in your shoes &amp; all that jazz. Your goal as far as bio is concerned is to put the LEAST amount of deal breakers as possible. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY
as a man, your value starts rising around 30 and expect your peak to be 45-55 if you play this game of life right. By that time, you'll get over caring so much, you'll be way more comfortable with yourself, and you should have enough investment in your job that making money will be your main priority..which is what women overwhelmingly respond to. This means that, if you're young, you should be focusing on that +50K job and even towards a +100K one if you have the brain capacity."

When you say ‚Äúcan you tell me something interesting about yourself?‚Äù You‚Äôre putting the onus on them to come up with a topic and an answer. The question is too broad, and answering this question requires a good amount of effort for someone you don‚Äôt know.
Consider asking a more targeted question, like ‚ÄúWhat do you like to do in your free time?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúDo you have any special talents?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is one of your insignificant accomplishment that makes you the most proud?‚Äù You can get some of the same answers to your original question, but are giving the person answering the question a place to start, ‚Äúfree time,‚Äù ‚Äútalents,‚Äù ‚Äúinsignificant accomplishments.‚Äù
Finally, responding to a dull answer ‚Äúsounds like a job interview.‚Äù with hostility is not worth your time.

I just looked it up number one cause and I wasnt asking for a source cuz I dont believe u Ik not everyone is demisexual I just figured if ur giving out a statistic u might have a source and I was curious about the statistics cuz I get curious about a lot of things but u made me have to look it up on my own ""But even if there's no perfect definition for a ‚Äúsexless‚Äù marriage, everyone seems to agree that they're common. Newsweek estimates that about 15 to 20 percent of couples are in one, and sexless marriage is the topic of myriad new books‚Äîlike Yager-Berkowitz's‚Äîand plenty of articles and columns.""  https://www.thehealthy.com/family/relationships/are-sexless-marriages-more-common-than-we-think/ and theres the source for that (reddits not letting me copy links in my text like I normally can)
Also so u know Im not saying sex isnt important which isnt what I said at all I just said its not as much for some people that wasnt even my point in the first place my point was that this guy is impatient theres a difference Im not enforcing demisexuality either but I did the research on the marrages failed due to lack of sex too for u ""In 15% of¬†marriages, the¬†couples¬†have not had¬†sex¬†for the past 6-12 months. This¬†lack¬†of intimacy can pose a real problem. The¬†marriage¬†turns into a platonic relationship and one party typically has built up feelings of resentment or anger, causing the¬†marriage¬†to eventually break down."" https://www.marylandlawhelp.com/how-intimacy-issues-can-lead-to-divorce/ but as u can clearly see thats way less then financial problems u actually dont know marrages 
And that girl shouldnt have to change anything about herself to find a decent man a decent man will really just care about intamacy and intamacy doesnt always have to be sex and Im not saying it CANT be Im saying it doesnt HAVE to be Im not saying that U CANT DO IT Im not JUDGING U FOR THAT Im saying everone is different I never enforced anything u just took it that way cuz ur sensitive asf and Ik u are otherwise u wouldnt be getting defensive about it that I said anything cuz I clearly did not say that all people are demisexual I did not say that Im judging u and I did not say that any straight person should change I just think that guy was falsely advertising himself and insensitive about it"

,MrBuccBucc,1618663758,,Bumble,"The answer, I feel, is more options in the dating filter than 'Men' and 'Women.' I understand why Bumble (probably) took a stance against people filtering out matches by sex, gender, identity, etc. but the net result is that the sort of assholes OP keeps hearing from are lumped into their match decks.   
Bumble might not like the idea of people filtering others so narrowly, but why should OP - who has been completely upfront and honest in their profile - have to put up with nastiness and bullying from people too stupid to look elsewhere in the first place.  
Whether people should/shouldn't filter out members X, Y or Z criteria is a separate issue. Overall, though, I'd rather see members like OP be able to rely on only being placed in the match decks of people open to meeting, so this sorta crap doesn't keep happening to them.

In anticipation of someone coming along and trying to accuse me of anything, I will state again my suggestion is based on getting assholes to *self-exclude*, not on any ideological judgement of anyone. I'm appalled by what OP has had to put up with, and it needs to stop immediately. 

Wider search filters may be the answer. Then OP doesn't have to check with every new match that they've bothered to read the gender, and doesn't have to keep dealing with being reported by the idiots that don't. I've suspected for a little while this sort of thing was going to happen, just based on the fact that Bumble gives wide latitude to us to decide who we should be shown too, but not the the equivalent filters in the searching direction.  


Regardless, I hope Bumble start to do right by you going forward, u/unusualsecrets8101 It shouldn't be on you at all to have to plead your case over and over when you did nothing wrong each time."
,bubblegrubs,1618663505,,Bumble,"""Something interesting about yourself"" is anything of your choosing to get the conversation going. If you cant think of anything to get a convo going from that then youre probably not that interesting.

,nearlydeadasababy,1618661562,,Bumble,"There are fucking great photos dude... the only very slight downside is one of the reasons they are good is the background is great and you are not the key feature, I don‚Äôt mean that negatively on you, just less ideal for dating profile. 

3 for main profile, maybe slightly cropped to focus on you. A main profile pic must be clear, primarily you and a good representation.

As for others 4... but not the second pic on profile as it‚Äôs a glasses shot you need to have given good opportunities to see full face before that comes up.

As for others 7,8,9 and 16. Think those are a good mix.

My general advice for pictures is... clear, good quality and primarily you for main photo then the following.... one activity shot, one sun glasses max, one low key with other people (ideally not with you draped on a women). Don‚Äôt repeat outfits if possible as you don‚Äôt want people to think it‚Äôs been a single effort. 

Obviously the hard thing is I don‚Äôt know you and I‚Äôm sure you have a better feeling on which pictures you like and represent you best. But from a neutral perspective I think they all look similar in terms of your look, another key thing is don‚Äôt have pics that make you look radically different because people will always focus on the worst of them,  not the best.

I think a lot of it is although you get on romantically I suppose it's not always meant to be. I will admit if I'm not feeling it after a few more days texting things tend to fizzle out.

In regards to be chatty and outgoing I do think I am I know it's quite a general description but I am always able to find some common ground with whoever I meet and get on well with most people (romantically or platonic).

When I say outgoing I suppose I mean I'm willing to do most things when it come to a time and place of dating. Happy to go for a walk grab finks food or do an activity type of thing and am quite proactive in continuing conversations. I think sometimes I may be a bit too much into conversation? I get nervous and tend to chat chat chat which I don't know if that puts people off (I do try and make sure if I'm talking I ask the other person about them and give them a chance so as not to come across as all about me me me).

At the end of the day,like I've replied to others, I'm not going to be compatible with everyone and even if it goes well for me it might not be going as well for the other person... Continuing to push through and hope that I'll meet someone who is after the same things as me.

Neah, you don't need help at all, but it seems like you are judging sexual people pretty harsh, Should I also judge your demisexuality as well like you judge this guy's sexuality? 2 months is patient, people just appreciate time more than others and they do not have time to mess around. Lots of people advertise themselves in a pleasent way and then they are not. Many women told me that personality matters for them the most and then turns out it is not true, so yeah, lots of people falsely advertise themselves, including women. Spineless and insensitive? This guy was funny through his text, he tried to not turn this into a big drama by writing like a medieval poet, I think this guy rejected her in the nicest and funniest way possible. He didn't force her into anything, he decided she is not for him and that is it. Well, for whatever reason she didn't wanted to have sex, he respected that, and so instead of forcing her, he let her go cause he didn't wait to wait anymore. Really? I don't think it is rocket science to know that over 50% of the population of the earth are heterosexuals and sexual creatures. It is biologically common and biologically normal as well, just google it for yourself. If it wasn't 50%, then I would've meet personally at least 1 assexual and I haven't so yeah ( and I am 30 years old ). You don't know marriages sweetie, trust me, most marriages fail because opf lack of sex, not because financial, not sure where the hell you ehard that from. So what, wanting sex is a bad thing now? Jesus Christ, you demisexuals are really self centred, aren't you and cannot look from any other perspective, huh? 2 months is long sweetheart, and not offering sex after 2 months,then that is a problem. It is your opinion anyway, I think the guy did really good and I think if the girl hopes she will find a good guy, then she needs a change. 
What if the sex isn't good? He waited 2 months just to find out that she is rubbish at sex or that she has a hairy pussy? Honestly now, sex is REALLY important in normal relationships, he did the right thing in my opinion. But you think what you want but could you kindly stop enforcing your demisexual views onto others? Not everyone is asexual or demisexual and more than 50% of the population aren't. Thanks."

Hes not patient also just cuz a girl doesnt want sex it doesnt necessarily mean its trust issues theres plenty of reasons a girl wouldnt want sex I was just using demisexuals and asexuals as an example but also personal morals all Im saying is that hes not actually patient and whats ur source for that 50% statistic? Marriage problems are more from financial problems then sex problems also ur time waste argument goes both ways some people dont wanna waste their body and time with someone whos not going to respect them or their boundaries in the long run holding off on sex is a good way to know if ur boundaries are going to be respected and if they get mad after 2 months of someone they barely know not wanting sex yet probably means they only care about sex not about u waiting longer in a relationship doesnt mean its going to be less often in the future just means u want to get to know the person first healthy relationships rarely start with sex

,theunknowngame,1618653269,,Bumble,"Asexuals and demisexuals are super rare, so why not let someone know that you are an asexual? Being sexual is common, so if you are an asexual you should always let your next date know before meeting them. 2 months is pretty long for some people, especially for older people. Some people appreciate time differently which is why they would prefer to not waste time on someone who has trust issues with men and refuses to show physical affection. You na asexual? Then find someone who is also an asexual, do not force a sexual man to convert into what you want cause thta is selfish.
Relationships are 50% sex at least, most of them anyway, sex is important and if you deny the rela value of sex, then you sre delusional. There are so many broken marriages and relationships just because sex is lacking."
,Anamon,1618653056,,Bumble,"It's been a year, it's totally fine to do that. If you check Bumble's support website, they have an entry about it and specifically say that it's okay.

They warn against doing it too often, but that's targetted at people who are doing this frequently to try and trick the system. You're going to piss people off if they keep swiping left on you and you keep reappearing a day later every time.

But I doubt people who saw you on the app a year or more ago are going to remember you when you show up again, given that you didn't even chat. In my opinion, returning to the app after having been in a relationship is probably the single most legit reason to do a reset."

Question is also , on how many dates have you gone so far? It's a game of statistics . Maybe you just went on dates that weren't compatible with you.

It might be the thing where you say that you are ""chatty"" and ""outgoing"", but I really doubt it. If I had a date that was more outgoing than me, I would either really appreciate that or if it bothered me , I would communicate that , and let her know what I feel.

,xassii,1618649087,,Bumble,"Assuming you're after a relationship rather than casual dating, be yourself, fill out your bio and questions, and ""show don't tell"" with your pictures.

What people find attractive in other varies, so don't try and aspire to looking or acting like something you are not: people looking for the fake image you create will only be disappointed when they realise you're not really like that, and people who would genuinely be attracted to the real you will swipe left if they're not into the image you've portrayed. Being yourself will get you higher quality matches more likely to go somewhere.

Fill out you bio, and look up advice on how to do it well (avoid negatives, avoid pointless fillers, and try to showcase who you are). Try to ""show don't tell"" here as well: so instead of ""I like cooking"" which is true but very generic, say your favourite dish to make - this then still shows you like cooking, while also letting people know what you find tasty, if it's complex, where the dish is from etc - it gives people way more to notice something in common with you and also more points for them use as conversation starters.

Make sure photos are clear, good quality and look like you - you're trying to find someone who likes you for who you are, misleading images will only get you hurt by rejection. Mix of face and body, avoid group shots and try to avoid pets. ""Show don't tell"" here too: show yourself doing the things you like rather than just poses if you can - this is another chance to show your personality and hobbies without taking up bio space. It also helps with conversation starters - if you say ""I like history"" there's less to jump from than if you show a picture of yourself at some ruins - the photo shows you like history AND you get out and do stuff AND the ruins - so people get more of an idea who you are and the image becomes an easy conversation starter.

Get friends to look at your profile, they'll be able to help suggest what works and what else you can change or add."

(This is going to sound harsh, but try and take it like a grain of salt. You seem to have good intentions--you just communicate yourself a bit poorly.)


1. Your profile pic: that would be better placed towards the end. Use a clear image of yourself (pref. smiling/not a selfie). You seem goofy/funny, but if you want to appeal to a larger audience, your first pic has to be your best and not just a silly pic. Otherwise people won't bother to look through the rest of your profile. (Don't cover your face with your hand)


2. Your bio has grammatical errors and has a bit of a commanding tone, which is unattractive. I'd strike the first line completely. Then it'd be a matter of re-ordering and rephrasing your bio. So:
A. Only use exclamation marks when you're genuinely excited about something. Otherwise it comes across as shouting. I'd recommend just 1 exclamation mark. 
B. Add an 's' to video 
C. ""...hammocks, and *I'm trying to become* a more well-rounded person.""
D. Then move the line ""skip the small talk"" to the very end. 

E. Alternatively, consider this rewrite: 
*I write films, edit videos, love swingin' in sun-kissed hammocks, and am OBSESSED with books. I'm currently reading [book name]. I aspire to be a more well-rounded person. Let's skip the small-talk and pretend we're already friends!* &lt;--still a bit cringe, but communicates your points a bit better.. 


3.  Last point would be to swap out the pic w the girl w another friend/group pic. Even if she's a friend/relative, someone viewing your profile might think otherwise. 


Again, I'm not trying to bash you. I hope this will help a bit."

The way you worded this sounds like you kind of panic-sent 2 subsequent messages after the compliment before he had the chance to reply. You don't have to send another (especially because you changed the subject already) - just wait for him to get back to you. :)

In the future, it kind of ruins the compliment if you immediately apologize and try to play it off like you didn't mean it though. Please sincerely mean, and then stand behind, the nice things you say to people.

It's not weird to be nice to him if you like him. He won't think it's weird. I think he would be happy to hear a sincere compliment :)

???

My understanding is that bumble ranks you based on your ratio of swipes to swiped on.  i.e. if you swipe a lot but are not swiped on very much, your profile has a low ratio and is shown to fewer people/other ""low quality"" profiles. 

Hence the desire to not swipe on 300 instagram models and get no matches, you tank your ranking.

Tinder AFAIK, just punishes you for swiping right too much in general"

,paisleyduck,1618625710,,Bumble,"I guess I just don't understand the point of this kind of experiment.

If someone matches with a catfish, it doesn't prove a successful bond is imminent. Maybe I'd find you attractive if I saw your real face but wasting time on this lie would reek of self worth issues and turn me off instantly.

Was it your hope that you'd have fewer matches with someone else's pictures than with your own? If you have enough matches, you'd never waste your time on that. Was it your hope that you'd have equal matches with someone else's pictures than with your own? What would be the point of knowing that? Was it your hope that you'd have more matches with someone else's pictures than with your own? What is the point of that? What is the point lol

As someone with your own good qualities, taking such poor care of yourself emotionally and being unkind to yourself as well as others who are on the app bodes poorly for your capacity for a healthy relationship with someone great. Please kindly consider that and focus on improving YOUR life, YOUR profile, etc. There's always something YOU can do that doesn't involve bitterness and jealousy and comparison and wasting your time playing devil's advocate.

Whatever the metric is, you can't always be the best. But you can always be your best.

Good luck."

If you want quality, then just be you. Put whatever pictures best scream you oj your profile. If that's you sitting drunk in great aunt Ethel's lap giving her bunny ears.....do that.

She'll love it i'm sure"
,WildwestJessy,1618602014,,Bumble,"Picnic date has work so well for me. I've always make it clear to the person I'm talking to that I'm not looking for a penpal. So 3 days of convo will be as far as it will go without having set up a date.

Choose a open place (park preferably who has either a good view or something special). 

Carefully prepare an ADULT picnic, (ideas Italian or Spanish cured meat assortment, olives, bread pre cut, hummus and vegetables sticks, boiled eggs/all those are best enjoy cold) a decent bottle of wine and plastic wine glass. Picnic blanket and if it a bit chilly, pack an extra clean warm jumper for her (don't want the cold to stop your good time).

Grab a coffee and show her why you choose this place, ask her what she think, if things are going well time to take out the picnic blanket. If no chemistry, well time to head home after coffee."

Answering 3 questions also makes sense. Will see which ones I can answer wittily."

,yuvalvv,1618600680,,Bumble,Can now confirm the previous likes are gone for good (can now swipe on profiles from the current beeline). This is complete bullshit.

,nearlydeadasababy,1618600432,,Bumble,"&gt;Anyone who gets turned away by that isn't worth dating or dealing with

You are thinking about it the wrong way... your choice, but your chances of getting matches will be seriously disadvantaged by this decision.

You think that you are filtering out people who don't support those causes or points of view... that is not it at all."
,just_anotherperson98,1618600151,,Bumble,"Hmm I see your point, thanks !"

,AvocadoTst,1618598129,,Bumble,"Honestly, there were well over 50, but that's the nature of being female - a lot of men swipe right on anyone who's even vaguely attractive.  I live downtown in a very densely populated city that's crawling with singles.

Don't read too much into it. These are likes, not matches or genuine connections. My method is to match with 1-2 people at a time who I pick from my Beeline and try to have a meaningful conversation with - a lot of the time they don't answer or barely engage. So a lot of these men aren't actually interested in me, I just passed the ""cute enough to swipe right on"" test. The numbers don't mean much."

,Magikality,1618597693,,Bumble,"Thanks for the kind words! I've gone with ""Software Engineer at Tech Company"", idk if that's good or not (i could put my actual employer but idk)."
,Magikality,1618597651,,Bumble,"Thanks for the thoughts! Yeah, I think I'd swap it out if I had a better one (there's one that would be perfect, but unfortunately I chose that moment to look like a total dumbass, so that one's out), but I'm not going to just get rid of it or replace it with another solo shot."
,OohDatSexyBody,1618597453,,Bumble,I've had the same experience and my guess is that there are just more people and bots using Tinder in my area than Bumble.
,AvocadoTst,1618597388,,Bumble,"If the convo is totally gone, he either deleted his account or was banned. If it was an unmatch you would still see him below your other conversations but showing as unmatched. 

Normally I would say don't even think about going but Bumble has been super glitchy today. Too bad it's far away otherwise I'd say just go with the intention of treating yourself to dinner and if he showed, all the better."
,krista37m,1618596795,,Bumble,Maybe that was it! No nothing yet still looking. I suppose I‚Äôll get there eventually.
,AvocadoTst,1618596761,,Bumble,Stop being so crabby. Read the other posts here - a bunch of people's beelines went empty overnight - I had 50+ people in my beeline and now zero. It's clearly a glitch.
,altinat,1618596748,,Bumble,"Yes they were likes... but losing them all at once is not normal. You're telling me all 15+ of them moved on and deleted the app when I was sleeping last night? And I understand they weren't matches. Sorry for using the wrong word. That being said, I'm not misplacing ego at all,  has nothing to do with it."

,Wrxeter,1618596396,,Bumble,"I‚Äôm off the app for the past 18 months...

But I used to find it fun to swipe two or three then go back to the beeline and see if the listings shrank. 

It was a mini game to see if I could damask the blurred images based on color averages in the photo I‚Äôm swiping on. It was actually kind of fun."
,Tsnacker77,1618596329,,Bumble,"They were only ""likes"" then, not MATCHES

lol...they probably moved on, and there was no certainty you would match with them anyway. I've had x100 dozen matches with women at the airport or on vacation in my city.

Misplaced ego and naivete with your approach."

,altinat,1618595984,,Bumble,"I am also M4F. I was referring to the beehive. I was farming female matches and waiting to match with them. Because if I match with them NOW I pretty much have to start hitting it off with them within 24 hours after they message me. I was waiting for summer before I match them officially, and activating the 24 hour countdown."

,Kyletn2000,1618595730,,Bumble,"Well, that‚Äôs just someone blatantly admitting that they are one."
,FrigginSargonMan,1618595577,,Bumble,"I'll definitely fill out the about me, but the ACAB/BLM and pronouns stay. Anyone who gets turned away by that isn't worth dating or dealing with"

,coreya75,1618595492,,Bumble,Yeah would have totally went with ‚Äúwell I can print an application out and mail it to you. Or you can instantly apply by calling (phone number)‚Äù. But dickhead here decided not to be clever.

,ros-bos,1618595457,,Bumble,"Ok this makes me feel better, same thing happened to me today. I figured they were punishing me for cancelling my premium."
,krista37m,1618595325,,Bumble,"He was the one that suggested the date, picked time and place. I mean we were only talking for like 10 days so it‚Äôs frustrating but I wasn‚Äôt emotionally attached or anything yet. Oh well, right?"
,AvocadoTst,1618595291,,Bumble,"I also noticed a couple places where it‚Äôs encouraging me to buy spotlight, that weren‚Äôt there before. So maybe they‚Äôre clearing out peoples likes in some stupid attempt to encourage them to buy spotlights? It sure as hell won‚Äôt work on me - I paid for premium for a reason. Super frustrating."
,rust_rat,1618595254,,Bumble,"well played, take my upvote"
,altinat,1618595188,,Bumble,"Seems like that makes 3-4 of us. Wonder if we will get them back. I would assume not, but that would be bad for premium sales."
,ParanoidAndroud,1618595183,,Bumble,"Had a time and place been set? Also, did he you out or you ask him? 
Unfortunately, some people are just shitty and they won‚Äôt think anything of setting up a date then unmatching. I suppose the good thing is that he weeded himself out quickly."
,AvocadoTst,1618595147,,Bumble,"I‚Äôm female and active on the app, and I have premium so I can see my beeline. 

As of yesterday I had 50+ people in my beeline and today it‚Äôs empty. This is clearly a glitch or a tech issue, not a punishment on OP for not being active."
,Jremmedy,1618595071,,Bumble,"If you have a means of communication through a different means check on that. Else, no don't go, he unmatched."
,AvocadoTst,1618595007,,Bumble,"Happened to me too. I had a lot of likes in my Beeline (I have premium so could see all of them) and as of today, zero. I‚Äôm active on the app but tend to only match a couple people at a time out of preference. 

I have to assume this is a glitch, not a calculated move to punish you as someone else said."
,Anamon,1618594912,,Bumble,"They have a FAQ entry on it, which claims it doesn't affect how often you're shown, they just warn against overdoing it because it annoys people to keep getting profiles they already swiped left on, and you might get reported.

That your beeline is empty might have a different reason, lots of people whose beeline was full suddenly noticed it was empty during the past 24 hours."
,silveretoile,1618594847,,Bumble,My profile says I‚Äôm a cat person. The amount of guys who immediately resort to pussy jokes is exhausting. That and the guy who said kitten pictures weren‚Äôt masculine enough for him.
,LoudSilence01,1618594813,,Bumble,You get me. Thanks man.
,altinat,1618594765,,Bumble,"Did it happen to you today? Because the person above is also reporting it happened to them today, which would make 3 of us."
,lejean,1618594687,,Bumble,"Oh totally! Fuck him though lol if he didn't even have the guts to tell you he wasn't interested, you didn't lose out on anything. He wouldn't have been good to you anyway."
,eyesarebeauty,1618594675,,Bumble,"I am in the exact same situation as you. I met someone that I thought could be a good potential relationship. We hit it off really well from the first day and things moved fast with us because we had such good chemistry. But after 3 weeks he just stopped texting and when I would text him, I wouldn‚Äôt get a reply until the next day or none at all. It is so frustrating and I feel so disrespected and hurt. Like we are adults, so we should behave like one as well. I am not afraid of rejection because it happens to all of us but what is worse for me is being ghosted by someone who I had genuine feelings for. Like if they aren‚Äôt interested then just say so. I have thought about texting him again but I end up rationalization with that thought and decided that he isn‚Äôt deserving of any of my time and/or attention. It really hurts because I really did like this guy but both parties need to put the effort and if they aren‚Äôt willing to put any then it‚Äôs best to move on. 

I wish you good luck on your journey and I hope you find someone special. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
,krista37m,1618594657,,Bumble,"Agreed. Like I said to someone else above, why can‚Äôt adults act like adults. You‚Äôre not going to hurt my feelings if after 10ish days of talking you decide to opt out."

,ellenajpie,1618594589,,Bumble,Same thing happened to me this morning!! All gone. Over 50 in the beehive gone ( a lot I couldn‚Äôt see because they were out of my area) but ones in my area are gone too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
,krista37m,1618594584,,Bumble,"Yeah, you‚Äôre right. If we would have been talking longer I‚Äôd be more disappointed but it was only like a week and a half so nothing really lost. It‚Äôs just frustrating."

,lejean,1618594255,,Bumble,"A lot of posts like this, at least lately. Never go when this happens. If they'd actually wanted to meet you, they would've contacted you and told you so outside of the app post-deletion. Assume the unmatch/delete = cancellation, especially since you don't have his number or any other means of contact. Pick up some good takeout by yourself and have a (likely) better night than you would've with him."
