"I have been on tinder for a while now 
I match a lot with people but I very rarely message first On the occasions that I have its because Im super super interested in the guy 

Am I right to assume then that the guys that I match with that dont message me first just arent that interested 

Im guessing that if they were super super interested in me they would message first 

If guys are matching with lots of girls I assume hes sending the first message to at least a few of these girls So clearly the ones that havent messaged just arent interested 

The more I think about it the more I feel uneasy about sending the first message 

What are everyones thoughts",1,664
"Ive had tinder for about a month and Im not sure why but its been doing this thing where its taking away matches with people who I know havent unmatched with me its so random has this happened with anyone else

Matched with a cute girl We had a short conversation and both live in a different city I asked her when she is going to show me around in her city

She responded with you tell me I told her I am only available tommorow because i am going on vavation the day after

She said that she had to work unfortunitly I said no problem and asked for her snap When on vacation i have send her a few snaps but she never responded to any of them She post a snap in her story every day

It now just feels weird to contact again and aks if we still are going to do something after 2 weeks Dont know what to do",1,629
"Not to brag but I have been told I am good looking and had no problem with women back in India After coming to the US for my Masters Degree pretty much my dating life died Just to give you a clear idea I am jackedworkout 6x a week Dress well 8910 face 5feet 10 inches Slight indian accent but fluent and a good Career After hundreds of swipes the only people who match with me are fat ladies trans people and cam girls looking for a fool

Like being indian and having brown skin is the only reason Im so low on the list From what I have researched and asked around I have come to learn that dating indianasian is avoided due to society standards Also that American women avoid indian men due to stigmasstereotypes like they objectify womenpoor hygiene have no gameetc I have no idea which of the above are true but I am forced to believe those could be the only reason I havent had any success

I was brought up in a western societywithin India and I dont see myself as culturally different from Americans That is why I made this post to check with other fellow indiansasians and find out if everyone is in the same boat or if they actually had success with tinder If you did please share your experience and how you pulled it off",1,1230

"This has probably been posted on here before and on the internet somewhere but I cant seem to find a definitive answer

Anyway my question is this are age range settings rigid in the sense that even if someone outside your age range swipes left on you will they still show up for you to potentially still match with them

For example if I was 27 years old and I have my age range set to 2129 and I swipe left on someone who is 21 but that person has their age range set to 2023 will Tinder still show me on their swipe screen because I swiped left on them even though I am out of their age range settings

I hope this makes sense",1,629

She said yes and suggested a different day because the day i proposed she wasnt able to go So thats a good sign 

Weve been talking for a while Idk if Im reading too much into this but lately I feel like I have to make the first move She still reaches out every now and then but lately I feel like Im always the one to reach out 

I didnt even know if she would accept the date but she did Its next Wednesday Gonna bring my big blanket my small speaker and some snacks 

Im hoping it goes well our first 2 dates were great I can tel this girl doesnt know what she wants because shes told me she isnt looking for anything serious However I did ask her if she wanted to keep things casual She told me she didnt know but that she wanted to keep seeing me 

Ill be honest that makes no sense to me but I do enjoy her company and am realizing that theres potential Im just trying to control my feelings and go with the flow

I had 4 chats open and we were planning to go out No one answered me in 10 hoursAre they dead all together 2 asked me to go out I didnt made the move Im so confused ,1,165
"First off let me say that this did not happen to me  This is a story I read on a forum that happened to someone else and I almost died laughing while reading  Hoping you will get a nice laugh out of it as well  So the context is a 30 year old guy is on a business trip gets on tinder matches with an older lady who he thinks is 50 years old and invites her to his hotel room When she gets there she is much older but thats not the biggest problem  See story below  


About two years ago I was on on a business trip in Florida Alone in my hotel room the little guy was becoming restless I got on tinder and started swiping  I came across this older lady and was intrigued so I swiped right  Due to the fact that I am truly a dog with a questionable moral compass my bucket list did contain nailing an older woman Lucky for me an opportunity had presented itself  We matched later that day she gave me her number and we coordinated her coming to my hotel room Perfect I thought until she arrived at my door When I opened the door she was standing there dressed nicely but much much older than her pics and stated age Id say she was around 75 Her profile said she was 50 Being a nice guy I still bring her into the room and we chatted a bit She seemed a little nervous Then she started to undress At that time I turned to flip the safety latch on my hotel door 

Thats when it happened I remembered hearing three loud pops I then thought is this how it ends Me in a hotel room with a strange woman my johnson out and in full glory mode that awful sound the smell of death in the air Yes its true she had just farted and I had to make a decision about what I was going to do next If I had known the woman I would have played this differently I would have just thought ok game on Im pretty confident in my abilities and quite respected as a formidable opponent in Dutch oven circles But I didnt know her and honestly I was taken aback I decided to handle the situation like the true gentleman again being kind that I am and pretend it never happened The night progressed One thing led to another and I found myself driving it home doggystyle 

Then it happened again This time instead of a popping sound it was a loud and long wisp of wind I thought maybe Im imagining things Maybe shes getting into my head She would not fart right on me or would she Without breaking stride I kept going After about 5 more seconds the scent left no doubt that my worst fears had been realized What should I do I could of spanked her right then and there Then again maybe that would make the problem worse Still solid as a rock I was not going to let these events detour me from my objective I have faced adversity before and when the going gets tough well you know Yet still I did not want her to be embarrassed just me thinking of others in my time of need I quickly deducted that doggystyle may not be the best position during these circumstances We switched to her giving me a blowjob Still fixated on my goal I asked her to stick her finger in my ass I typically am not a big fan but I needed to quickly switch things up to stay focused She commented ok not sure what everyones fascination with the butt is all about these days she then complied  

Regaining my focus It happened once more except this time it was the loud popping type like what happened when she first entered my room This time she acknowledged the problem and while looking at me square in the face  sorry just a little popcorn gas no big deal  No big deal  Yeah it is a big deal  Who even says this This was gas from a corned beef and cabbage dinner maybe even a bad egg roll I dont know but it was not popcorn I started thinking what the hell is wrong with this woman Has she no class at all I can understand once maybe twice hell we are all human but this is getting ridiculous Shit I was beginning to lose my troops My focus was fading the little guy felt like he was starting to throw in the towel I can usually get a second wind Not this time Although I won a few of the battles along the way I had lost the war I graciously accepted the defeat",1,4104
To those that think its a bad thing that she unmatched without a response to your message dont feel down most of the girls that do it are dryshites that cant keep up a conversation anyway so dont worry about it most girls that depend on a chatup line to actually respond tend to be dead in bed anyway ,1,301
When I try to match with the people who liked me it says failed to match error And its doing it on all of them Not one or two What is happening I cant find any info anywhere on this,1,181
As a young woman who doesnt take tinder very seriously Ive met some awesome people on there I dont think twice before sending a message whether its messaging someone first or just replying and my results have been pretty good so far I can see why some people post for some help in certain responsessituations on here but if you arent sure how to say hello or even continue a simple conversation how are yall gonna meet up in person The best way to have the right people come to you is just being yourself Take life a lil less seriously amp Happy swiping,1,553
So is something wrong with tinder today I tried deleting my account on app and chrome but nothing worked,1,104
"First of all Im M22 not using Tinder or a swipebased app so Im messaging someone F23 out of the blue before theyve decided whether they like me or not It is on a dating app ofc but not swipebased And I really want this to be successful cos theyre absolutely gorgeous so although I have a rough idea of what to say thats why I wanted to confirm whats the best way to write the first message by asking what you all think If it helps for the post she seems like the cute and fun type of girl there isnt a huge lot of info on her profile other than horse riding which i cant relate to at all food and fun

So I can either do the whole friendly introduction and pop up like Hey im this and that so what do u get up to in ur free time  to make urself seem nice make them feel comfortable before potentially chatting to u

Or I can go with an interesting conversation starter like if u were a crisp what type of crisp would u be and why probably the one id go with or what one thing could u not live without or so on basically the stuff from this articlehttpsconversationstartersworldcomicebreakerquestions  to pop up with an interesting question thatll hopefully make them wanna respond

The thing is different peoplesources say that each approach is better but I want to know which approach is actually the best way to go Friendly pop up or interesting ice breaker Vote in the poll and comment whatever below all help appreciated

but after taking a closer look at her photos i started to realize that she kind of looks masculine 

now before i continue i just want to make it clear i have absolutely no problems with someoneanyone being lgbt in this case possibly trans but theyre just not my personal preference to date or have romanticsexual relations with 

to continue on i noticed that she looked masculine but also feminine at the same time i personally cant tell if theyre trans or if they just happen to have such genetics 

i do plan to ask if they happen to be transgender but i know a question like that can seem insensitive mean or too personal especially since we literally just met a couple days ago

"I use tinder to hook up

I am not looking for a relationship 

In my bio I dont list anything inappropriate It simply says I am dominant  rough and into bdsm and looking for a hook up or fwb thats literally it 

I have no inappropriate images in my profile

I never say anything sexually inappropriate to women If I match with someone I say did you read my bio just to make sure they understand my intentions without me having to waste their time 

Some women are into it Ive hooked up before with attractive women using tinder it works 

However I have gone through like 3 or 4 accounts being banned I am constantly being reported and threatened to being banned Bio erased for sexual content or simply being reported by women why I have no idea why but any reason they want apparently  and then boom account banned with no possible way to dispute or retrieve it back 

Meanwhile I come across tinder profiles all the time of women literally saying in their bios that they suck dick tits are out ass is out in a thong or whatever and thats perfectly fine I couldnt even upload a shirtless pic of me unless it was at the beach 

If tinder is supposed to be a hookup app why is it so vanilla and antimen 

I understand there are issues of safety and such and incels etc but this app is fucking ridiculous at pretending it isnt a hookup app when thats absolutely what it is 

all due respect to those who want to find relationships and do find them on tinder or other dating apps but when is everything so uptight there",1,1516

Dear reader Im unsure how I am still alive to write down the tales of yesterday night  The fact I mustve been unconscious exposed to winters biting winds for what mustve been hours shouldve sealed my fate  However destiny must have greater things waiting in store  I woke up staring at a grey unwelcoming sky  It was morning  I sat up postrate alarmed and not yet recalling what transpired to get me to the wretched place  The conical structure of the shrine dominated my view  I was right where yesterday left me  There was no time to think about the sheer madness and misfortune that lead me here  The blizzard had weakened somewhat but the cold was already seeping through the layers of thick fur and padding insulating my body  I got up and marched my way back to camp

As of returning to the relative safety of my tent Ive spent the last several hours recording my experiences of today and the day prior  Despite my shivering hands and the ink within my various pens having frozen overnight I eventually managed to write this account down onto paper before my memory faded  I am exhausted beaten afraid for the future  My entire body aches  I can feel my heart pounding behind my eyes  My partiallyfrostbitten fingers feel like theyve been assaulted by a heavy stone  Despite all these myriad excuses I can at least feel accomplished for having provided the one who comes across this account with a compelling account of woe and whimsy  if nothing else  I certainly hope this poor souls fantastical story wont end on such a sour note

Ive relit the fire with my last bit of energy  Reflection must wait for tomorrow

Today I rest",1,1942

Now to my main question On my bio I mention my weight loss Its not a huge part of my bio other topics take precedence Showing friends my bio the one sentence about my weight loss is getting mixed reactions Some are saying its great to show that accomplishment Others are saying it would make women worry about me regaining or that I still have the whole flying squirrel loose skin thing going on

"Two days ago i get back on Tinder again after 2 months break Back then my profile was successful after coming back i probably got a noob boost 20 likes in like 5 minutes then zero My profile is fine im tall girls say im handsome i play guitar im smiling no selfies one photo from travel etc As i said it worked 2 months ago   


But now Tinder is trying so hard to encourage me to pay that i cant even Today it gave me a Boost to try I tried got many likes but now the girls liked me dont even show up on my swiping list I just can swipe forever and i wont find them So now the app is encouraging me to pay for Gold to match all the girls in one second

Im just laughing at how that algorithm works I think the best way would be to wait for like a week without any activity and see if something has changed For now the app is unusable in the free version Please let me know how it works for you",1,905
"Hi folks  


So over the last 6 months that Ive been on Tinder Ive managed to get roughly 300 matches Im in a major city in the UK so the population is good and had plenty of conversations some more successful than others around 10 of which led to agreeing to meet up but zero dateshookups those who did agree to go on a date either unmatched or otherwise bailed out on it shortly after  
This leads me to believe that my profile is okay and that I at least know how to have a decent conversation on Tinder but that either I suck at sealing the deal or the women Ive been matching with just arent looking for the same thing that I am ie something casuala hookupa freakin IRL date and not just a penpal  


Also from what Ive seen not a single person Ive matched with was interested in a hookup Not one And when I even mentioned the word hookup in a conversation the outcome was rarely positive it usually led to an unmatch or ghosting Which tbh surprised me as I thought Tinder had a reputation for being a hookup site primarily Also bearing in mind that some of the women Ive matched with had nothing in their profiles except attractive photos and no bios which doesnt indicate theyre after a serious relationship right  


I get that the lockdownpandemic probably contributed to the lack of dateshookupsIRL meetups but Im finding it hard to believe that after this number of matches there wouldnt have been 1 single date I dont know if anyone else is in the same boat  I hope not  


So anyone got any advice What should I be doing if Im only interested in something casuala hookup Should I try to include more bold photos  I definitely dont have any toplesssixpack photos at the moment Should I state that Im only after something casuala hookup in my bio again conscious of the seemingly negative reaction Ive had when I mentioned this in conversations  


Thank you very much if youve read this far  any advicethoughts is much appreciated",1,1942

"Men on tinder in my experience seem to be incapable of holding conversations so these are my tips that I wish the guys I match with actually knew

1 Always think about how the other person would reply to your message before sending and if they would even able to reply aka end it with a question

2 Refrain from typing an entire paragraph about yourself or your work stress etc if I barely even know you Im not a free therapist

3 If someone doesnt reply please dont follow up with them after a few hours or even days if they dont reply to the first message they arent interested

4 Dont send gifs or cheesy pickup lines instead of actual messages ask a question about their bio or something theyre interested in you know make it seem like youre actually interested in them as a person

5 Dont send any overtly sexual messages unless thats their obvious intention shown in their bio even if they have revealing photos just dont be a creep

Hoping I will find someone who is actually capable of answers that arent dry or even a grain of effort in conversating in the future for now probably just going to give up",1,1111

"People often ignore me on tinder because of my looks So I built an app that focus on your personalities 

You may be an ordinary looking guy who is kind funny hardworking active and passionate for life yet people dismiss all of it without knowing the full picture In this app you can tag yourself with placesscenarios that would boost your profile The scenarios appears as the background of your profile picture so when people see your profile picture they automatically sees the scenario

At the same time you can also search for people who are interested in these scenarios All these scenarios give you common language to start highlight the angles you really shine and help separate yourself from the crowd 

I hope this can help you feel more confident and less selfconscious about your looks

Hey guys I made a comeback to Tinder after 2 months break the period of time in which app was uninstalled Before uninstalling my profile was very successful Im a journalist playing guitar i sincerely laugh on my first photo my bio is also funny and i wrote there my height as i am pretty tall I had a lot of likes and i think that is because i havent really cared about it I launched the app once in a blue moon made few swipes the second card was always a Like obviously sometimes sent a message and get out of the app

But now i wanted to spend some more time active in the app to meet someone etc Installed the app added a new photo or two but the core of my profile hasnt change Just after installing the app i got like 20 likes but since then i get none I know about the noob boost but the account is not new It is 5 years old and i just reinstalled the app

"Will try to keep this short as possible also sorry if there are some grammar errors English is my third language

So The other day I matched with a girl shared some interests we both connected and we switched phones

We where supposed to meet but then I did catch covid so I had to quarantine During that time I stopped talking cause I wasnt in the mood for it she made a couple efforts to start the convo but things died slowly 
But now that I am recovered we have been talking and we do share a LOT of things She even asked me if I wanted to form a team for some project 

Everything going very welleven got a new date set up

BUT

1 She is constantly talking about how its EXbf is very possessive about the chats and whom she talks to Even when they have broken up and sometimes she is like Damn I gotta go and see my EXbf cause this and that  I know it sounds silly but it doesnt look normal at all for me like why so Much control if you two are already done 

 So I am kinda worried that they havent actually broken up and I might step into a relationship 

2 Im kinda worried that the project is a way to suck some money out of me and then block me Like Its an amazing project and I am all in but it whould mean putting some money in the fate of a Unkown individual and That is a big nono

For the other side I was the one that did suggest I could help a bit on the project I have my far share of people that could help on it

I have noticed in this time frame how many people you can match with or find and you can go all the way to asking about a date then nothing

I feel my profile matches me to my best extent active photos selfies group phots full body shots goofy photos etc Was texting a match for nearly 3 days now she asks for a photo I send one havent heard a thing in two days LOL but you best believe she is viewing my snaps

I know some things can be pulled from age and maturity  Im just curious how many this has happened to and what do you all do I know that it can be way worse and I can just never match with someone at all but tbh I would RATHER have that happen then go through all this BS for you to ghost me randomly

2 the majority of White men in this area definitely do not like Black women which is fine with me honestly Ive tried to branch out and try to match with a couple white guys but of course they would never swipe right on me

This was our second date Prior to us going out she had texted me earlier in the day saying she was down to go back to my place but wasnt ready for sex I understood When we got back to my place we danced in my living room and then cuddled up in the couch and watched a movie 

Things got pretty frisky Weve made out on each date so far This last time we were lip biting shirt tugging and she was on top of my riding her clit while she had her leggings on over my hard dick in my pants Since she told me she wasnt ready for sex I didnt take things further and she didnt seem to mind 

Should I have tried taking things further Im not one to make unwanted sexual advances Since she explicitly told me she wasnt ready and had told me she doesnt sleep around on multiple occasions I didnt take things further

"So I have about 15 matches and all of them are really bad at conversation And if all my matches are like this I feel like its a me problem if all of them are like this

How do you get a response that isnt low effort",1,411

Hi there Ive had a number of tinder accounts over the years they never did well Ive always done resets in hopes that it would get better the next time but it mostly just gets worse I deleted my tinder about 2 months ago and my most recent account reset was from about a week ago I had a female friend pick my pictures But since I started the new account Ive only gotten likes from Transgender men and women nonbinary women creepy men that registered as women plussized women and women in their late 40s While I have nothing against any of these groups of people I think its just frustrating that tinder is sending me on a wild goose chase I asked two of my female friends to try swiping on me and they tried looking for me even while sitting next to me but they couldnt find me I found both of them and swiped right on both of them In about a week Ive only gotten 3 matches And of these 3 only one replied So Im also not sure my matches are getting my messages

So basically I think tinder is only showing my account to people with the lowest ELO score I would like to hear what everyone else thinks about this 

Anyway I got a new phone and a new phone number Registered a new Google account and all I want to try doing a Nuclear bomb reset Could someone tell me what else needs to be added to this checklist 
New phoneNewphone number 
New email
Pictures cropped with Instagram and redownloaded Any less stressful option would be appreciated",1,1443

I used tinder a long time ago and there was a trend whenever Id come back on Id usually match with the second person it showed me assuming it said someone already liked me But now Ive got 20 likes and no matter what distance I allow i never match anyone Is tinder just trying to force everyone to buy gold or whatever,1,317

"Hello guys 

Im a tinder gold user and Im planning on upgrading It to platinum

How is that Any clue",1,241
It was all dead on the tinder front for a while I went on yesterday for 10 minutes and stacked up 8 matchs I messaged them all first and have had nothing back Ive tried reinstalling and logging in and out but still nothing either its a pack of ghosts or and issue with the app any one had something similar,1,306
"He said since he didnt hear from me in time so he already made other plans I ended up going out with my friends and we ended up at a bar near his place so I let him know just in case he had time to stop by At first he said he would try and then later on he said he had an unexpected sleepover

This guy isnt my boyfriend and we arent exclusive but am I in the wrong for feeling weird about the whole thing I know that 37 min isnt a short amount of time but I feel like it was so quick for him to make other plans Especially plans to invite who I assume to be another girl to have sex with 

How long would you have waited before making other plans Is 37 min too long

I really like this guy so far but I feel like just a number",1,727

"Because I am frustrated and desperate I have recently changed the settings to show both males and females to me in discovery because in all my time of using Tinder with it set to females I have not gotten any likes
But I am not interested in men still set it like that because I am desperate
Thing just is now I have 6 likes from users that are 100 males and I would really prefer to get them out of my Liked you section I have even set my settings to only show me males and have swiped right a lot but it does not seem like the ones that liked me come up even  
Also I have swiped right on one person that liked me I know it was them because of the picture looking just like the blurred one in my Liked you section but they still are in there even if I swiped right on them  
Can someone explain this to me I know it was dumb to change the settings like this when I am heterosexual",1,882

Sooo I swiped right on the girls Im interested in and left on the rest until I had zero likes left I swiped left on nearly 200 girls I went a whole week with ZERO new likes and decided to just pay for a boost to see if anything changes and boom a whole bunch of new likes I think the app got upset that I swiped left on everyone so they punished me by not showing my profile to anyone until I pay for a boost lmao,1,413

"I 21 M am pretty introverted and goes to school online so I dont really talk to many peoplemeet girls that often  I want to use Tinder again for hookups or some type of relationship depends on the person but I didnt have much success before My pictures were definitely not that great since I rarely take pictures of myself while aIm out and didnt have any interesting ones and Im pretty sure my bio has sounded boring or dumb before Im not good with words

Im looking for advice on how to express interest in your bio for just wanting to hookup or wanting to hookup with possibility of a relationship Is there a way to implicitly say this without coming off sketchy I know many guys just say a little about themselves in their bio but dont say what they want I feel like this works for very attractive looking guys who go out a lot and take trips every weekend but for me very good looking guy but temporarily chubby and doesnt like to go out all the time Id like to cater to girls that just want to fuck somebody that looks like a mediocre old male pornstar that somehow still has a lot of views me


If you guys could throw out some bio recommendations or picture tips that would make my profile more swiperightable in your opinion Id love to hear it Thanks for the help ",1,1273
"Ive had mixed results Ive met some girls after only a few days after the match and sometimes its taken up to 3 weeks of chatting

I just wanna share an story that happened to me today I was scrolling through tinder and I saw my best friends ex bf and I was just being nosey clicking through and I got a notification so I tried swiping it away and I accidentally superliked him and he didnt like me back yet so I couldnt unmatch instantly So I try to not think about how embarrassing that was until I get a DM from him on Instagram and he says hes always felt the same way about me and that hes glad to see the feelings were reciprocated LMAO oh no instant block and Im glad she finally dumped him a long time ago but thought that this story was kinda funny to share,1,635
So I made a tinder two days ago and received 6 likes and havent been able to find the majority of them I found the first like relatively quickly but Ive been swiping a lot today and havent been able to find the others Ive even changed my range and what not and still nothing Is there any way to see the likes faster without paying for premium,1,342

"I wanted to post this in rAskReddit but needed to give some context to my question 

Three times in the past week Ive been deleted by women on OLD sites after suggesting we vidchat Ive been catfished in the past and like to vidchat before meeting to ensure theres chemistry  In each situation the conversation was fun amp flirty and I waited a few days before asking  These sites have builtin vidchat so theres no exchange of personal info

So Im trying to figure out what the issue is If its about being shy then how would we ever meet in person If its about seeing unwanted dick which Ive never done because Im not a street flasher then why not simply agree for all parties to keep their clothes on  Maybe I just had a bad string of luck and caught a bunch of catfish

Ok so flash forward to now It seems like Im not being seen at all on the app I even ran an experiment where I bought a super boost thing and that gave me like 30 more likes or something But then the last two days literally not even one like Did I get shadow banned Whats going on I cant even match with girls I previously matched with last time I restarted my account",1,881

anyways hes hot af i couldnt believe a girl like me would match with him we started our conversation he seemed like a genuine and sweet guy we then met irl the next day cuz we live so close hes really hot af he took me to a quiet bar taught me to play pool lol and obviously he touched me when teaching me the positions etc then we had a really good talk i like this guy tho hes gonna move into the city soon 

so he invited me over to his place that night it was super late like around midnight i was never home this late nevertheless i agreed cuz i gotta live a lil i didnt really have any intentions to have sex tho i was happy to make out and cuddle etc but turns out he wanted to have sex i refused and promised i would be back the next day cuz i was not ready and it was too late i needed to go home he then let me go although seemed a lil disppointed and seemed like he really didnt want me to leave as if he liked me

the next day i went over and he acted like a completely different person he kicked the router cuz the internet wasnt working he was always on his phone instead of watching the movie with me which was what he wanted us to do when he asked me to come then suddenly he took me to his bedroom and took off his clothes suddenly wanted to f lol without any foreplay i was so dry cuz apparently i was pissed by his change of attitude towards me plus his sudden want to f

well eventually we didnt make love i wanted to cuz hes hot af but my body said no it was dry af and if we did it im sure id be painful he was pissed after two failed attempts the second time he decided to give up having sex with me he lol immediately asked when r u gonna leave i answered i can leave now he said that would be great

lol

are hot guys in general like this like so privileged and take it for granted that girls should give them sexual pleasure etc and that ugly girls have no worth besides sexually satisfying them that was how he made me feel then i realize good appearance could be an alarming signal just like beautiful animals with camouflage they r actually toxic",1,2252

Dating is hard enough for everyone Should I swipe right on men I could find attractive Is that insulting sort of giving them a chance I dont want to be mean or rude just figured Id ask 

I know I really do find personality important and it makes a huge difference a lot of time in my attraction  


Honestly your guys photos suck 70 of the time My mind does a 3D filter to try and see what you actually could look like",1,587

Why does tinder get rid of some of my matches Theyll re appear after like a day or so but I normally assume they unmatched me or something but then my matches will pop back up with none of our previous conversion Its actually ruined my chances with someone doing this before and I dont know how to fix it ,1,305

Hi im new to tinder I was trying to buy the gold subscribtion but it didnt worked Anyone have the sqme problem I cant buy any subscriptions,1,139
I was scrolling thru tinder and I saw many women who were pushing feminism with words but promoting sexism with their pics IDK which is more important to them being a strong woman or being a sex object,1,201

I matched with a girl today At that moment my train came so klicked one the x in the corner and not typped something I had the intetion to write later when I was back home but now I cannot find her to write her something in the app Did I throw that match away or is there a possibility to recover it",1,360

I signed up for Tinder Gold just to see what its like I have had the free version for awhile It seems like every potential match is like 100200 miles away I live near a pretty big metropolitan city close to a million people Yet almost every match is 100200 miles away in some small country town I have my range from 1835 and the mileage to like 60 I tried decreasing the mileage to 15 miles and only one potential match There has to be some kind of algorithm working here Anyone else experience this before,1,506
Seems like girls love throwing stuff like ACAB BLM two doses etc in their bios Have any other guys tested also similar stuff and found an increase in matches,1,157
For me its really hard to match with people even though I have tinder gold and I can see who likes me But everytime I match with someone Id send a message and then Id get no reply back EVER I dont understand whats going on here Is it something Im doing How do I get more people to message me,1,291

"So I 27F matched with this really good looking guy 27M about 69 miles away from me I matched using Gold and honestly I normally would not give a guy more than 25 miles from me the time of day but this guy wasoof

And the first thing he said to me was not come to my house to cuddle wink or your leggings would look good on my floor  both of which Ive gotten so this was already starting out pretty good His account is verified which I dont know if that actually means anything Like how accurate is that

But anyways he asks for extra pics which I assume its so he can verify Im not a catfish So he asks for my snapchat but I dont have one because Im just not that into social media or constantly taking photos or videos of myself My Facebook and Instagram have not been updated in I know like over 6 months Im just not that into it I tell him I dont have one but we can exchange numbers or video chat He asks me again to send him a pic which I dont mind but I dont think he knew you cant send pics via Tinder So I tell him that little fact since he completely avoided my initial suggestions of exchanging numbers or videochatting Then he asks me to make a snapchat and Im likewtf

My spidey senses start tingling Whats his endgame here I get not necessarily wanting to videochat someone you dont know But what about the number thing Is he just trying to get nudes without giving his personal number or is he just super cautious about giving out his number Like women are Is he a catfish despite being verified

I know you guys obviously cant answer that but am I right to think something is off here Should I even bother making a snapchat I wont use",1,1649

So Im making a multiplemessage pickup line and in the end youre supposed to get her phone number But the phone number has no use if were already talking on tinder so what do you think the next step is Just ask her out for a date after a pickup line Or tell her jokingly that okay I dont know what to do with a number now I could also ask for Facebook but it feels like privacy invading Maybe ask for either phone or facebook Many people would just initiate a conversation I guess What do you think,1,497

Im thinking I need to switch something up with my texting or this is just the reality of tinder I have a chiseled body and have that pretty boy look which gets me lots of matches not that any of that matters but Im just giving my perspective but every time I have conversation with some girls it seems smooth up until I ask to get her number then Ill get unmatched Ive had some where its great and I get the number and we go on dates but vast majority just dont have any interest in taking things further and its quiet frustrating its almost like sometimes Ill be the only one putting in effort on text with some and then when I go for the number I get unmatched Is this just something I have to get used to or am I doing something wrong,1,737
Hey guys Ive been on tinder for the past couple months now its been going goodish Ive been getting matches but the thing that really busts my balls is that a good chunk of these matches are just women trying to hustle their onlyfans account like theres literally pornhub what the fuck are you doing here just something I had to get off my chest dont even get me started on the other problems Ive encountered anyone else have these terrible matches,1,447
"I matched with a woman and was showing interest and asking questions After her many 15 word responses and general lack of interest in getting to know me I called her out on the bullshit dry texts and said Ive been talking to you and getting to know you and you havent asked one question about me or showed interest and you respond extremely slow She responds with sorry but Im working forget about a date now 

I was talking to her for only 2 days and she would respond every 35 hours I work a ton also and still respond in 20 mins or less and if Im busy Ill notify the person that I am like an adult Why cant they just say Im not that interested in you instead of making excuses Funny part is she acted like I cared about a date after I lost interest from the dry texts and called her out",1,789

So Ive been seeing these on some profiles lately Think Tinder has it under lifestyle Cant seem to do it on my own account though Is it a paid feature or are they only trialing it on some accountshttpspreviewredditnjbhward60b71jpgwidth1080ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsfbfd733c76112a7204861207706a0df0e79f8b2f",1,316

We match and I say  Isnt awful that the Fukushima tragedy is still happening

She responds  I am 100 certain that we will never match plus more stuff I cant remember  

I responded  Certainty is always 100

My memory sucks but I think a few months ago they released a bunch of radioactive water into the ocean again  When I wrote that they were finding fish on the coast of California with isotopes matching Fukushima  I told this story on stage and a woman said out loud its not still going on",1,585
"Ok Ladies hear me out
 The last several guys I met online have been around my same height This is just a weird coincidence since I dont think I knew some of their heights before meeting Some of this has led to dating like a year or more some just really good times or longterm FWB kinda stuff
 So here are some reasons not to care about if a guy is super tall or not
 You never have to crane your neck up to look at them kiss them This is just good spinal health it leads to more making out and easy stolen kisses When walking side by side it is super easy for him to grab your assthis is just nice
 You are equally likely to be struck by lightning because its 2021 people equality matters 
In my experience the sex is amazingthis could be coronation and not causation 
You dont have to change the seat and all of the mirrors a bunch when you drive their cars
 And finally there is nothing like genuine connection and that is easier when you can stare into each others eyes ok but dont make it weird",1,999
Gets 65 likes the first few days and slowely have no likesmatches later I dmed atleast 7 people on there and only half would reply back i suck at texting but overall i know i attract the art ho3salternate ones and i like them too Tinder gives me so many of them and i swipe right on them but NO matches But when i started i got a lot of them Im not sure if i am banned and they cant swipe back or even see me Why would Tinder let me see them and swipe but not let others see me Abusive,1,485
"So I met this girl on Tinder cute very talkative likes to talk all the time I try to make time to talk to her but Im busy Weve been talking for a few months now and to be honest Im the reason we havent met yet I had some health issues Ive been focused on along with work life etc Anywho this morning she texts me at 630am And she does so without knowing if I am awake or not and if the alerts on my phone are on or off etc

So after she messages me good morning I respond with you message me at 630am in the morning Her response  Ya I woke up early Im at work now 16 hr shift today I respond back with  I dont care what time you fucking wake up you cant assume that Im awake at 630am in the morning its not cool

And she responds with whats wrong with that

And from there she just basically makes it out like she did nothing wrong no apology Nothing And eventually she starts asking me if Im on my period did you have mood swing today

Am I the asshole Im pretty sure I am not",1,977

"I recently downloaded tinder again and this one guys profile keeps popping up
Hes someone I dont really know personally but I know he lives locally and Ive heard of him Mainly because there was another guy I kind of causally datedtalked to on and off for a couple of years that is friends with him 

His card has come up several times and I always exit the app or I change my distance settings I may get a few more swipes in and  then his card pops up again 

Ive debated about swiping right and seeing where things go but it could be an awkward situation if things do progress with him because of the other guy Like if theyre friends and he starts dating me idk how that goes with bro code

Also in the past I was in a similar situation where I matched with a guy I knew from college on an app and we went out a few times before things fizzled out I went back on the app and ended up matching with a friend of his I didnt know at the time and then they both ended up giving me shit for it",1,989

"I just joined tinder after ages and the pricing is preposterous 4899 a month for gold and 6599 a month for platinum
This is actually laughable tinder has turned to such shit They dont ever push your matches on the free version so you will never get any matches You can swipe for days and days and days and never match with anyone despite having xx likes 

Tinder is pretty much pointless without gold as you will never get a match Such a rip off",1,445

I am not gendering this Ive known people that are very young that make Tinder accounts with false ages Ive known 16 year olds that dated 22 year olds and the 22 year old didnt even know that the other person is 16 and nit 20 How do you not be sceptical of age on this platform Just a genuine question Ive recently learned that people got in trouble for sexting minors on the platform even though they had know idea they were sexting a minor,1,440

Hello Wondering if anybody has had this before I matched with a guy and we messaged today I went back on the app and our messages are gone but he still appears in my matched section It just appears as if we never messaged Is this a glitch Where did our messages go He didnt unmatch me because he still appears as a match Has anyone had this before I think this has happened at least twice now,1,392
Just wondering if its better to only have people you swipe on see your profile I dont like the fact that the only people that normally get on my like queue are girls I am really not attracted to too Overweight or too old I wonder if theyre the ones easily swiping on me if it brings down my ELO,1,294
I have seen a lot of person on Tinder who are 100 would be interested in me like i am for them I swipe them but it says we dont match I aint saying they didnt decline or didnt want me but im 100 sure they arent seeing my profile yet Is it to purposely make us pay for us to get easier matching in the system I think i will get match with them but it might take weeks I think Tinder does this on purpose ,1,403

Hi Im 19 and Ive been using Tinder since Im 17 my profile doesnt have any photos of me and I have an anime photo I usually match up with the guys I like so after that I give them my Instagram to get to know me I consider myself a fairly attractive and normal girl Whenever I have met men I tend to ignore them or not pay attention to them because I dont like them too much I recently made a match with a 24yearold man that I really liked a lot and we shared our Instagrams he was nice but you could tell that he was not very enthusiastic about talking to me he told me that he felt ugly and that his heart was broken recently We talked about that and related issues I admit that she was the one who put the topics and he just answered and suddenly he blocked me I cried and everything wrong A few ago I met another men 32 years old I know he was too old for me who also attracted me too much I spoke a little desperate  too but there was more reciprocity he invited me to go out and everything and he said I was pretty A few days passed and he never proposed a day I asked him when and he didnt know I was trying to put a topic of conversation and I proposed a date and time for us to meet and he blocked me

Advice or similar situations to recover from such humiliation Im depressed",1,1285
"Ive been testing a theory a fun theory
I still try to use properish grammar but I noticed one of my friends turned off their caps and they got more engaged results so I did the same

my sentences now look like this no periods at the end either 

I might start one with a caps on every now and then just to be respectful but after a couple lines I just stop

 According to my friend supposedly it makes the conversation look less formal and more casual makes anxious people less anxious to meet etc  She says it also makes WHEN YOU USE CAPS like this look more exciting or some jumbo like that 

If I send a paragraph I break it up into smaller ones if I do send a big one I just text it regularly lol thats just what I do now 

Believe it or not dropping the CAPS actually worked Conversations last longer ive gotten some numbers a couple of dates and so noticed people are more engaged in the conversation


Outside of tinder I continued this and even my texting and communication with family and friends has improved too I now only text formally for important things or coworkers or my parents

give it a shot and lemme know how it goes for you guys",1,1151

"Ive been using tinder for about a month and my account was at 29 potential matches a couple days ago I wasnt really getting any matches the last couple days and the potential match images were people I already swiped left on so I added new pictures of me to see if that would do anything

 I dont have tinder gold but I could see the blurred photos were already missed matches If I matched with someone the number would also drop But today I started swiping again and matched with 8 new people all without dropping the potential matches or showing any indication I had someone new who liked my profile Im assuming theres way more that swiped right on my account that I cant see is there a way to update this",1,707
So I went on a date with a guy from an app it was fine but nothing earthshattering I knew by the end of the date that I didnt want to go on a second one but when we stood up to leave he asked if I wanted to go on a second date and I said yes Clearly this was a mistake but I find inperson rejection of basically strangers difficult What text do I send now Do I need to pretend I changed my mind Do I just say hey I said yes but I shouldnt have Looking for something quick and respectful,1,486
It doesnt connect to anyone whenever I use it I just end up sitting there for 5 minutes like a dumbass,1,102
I dont know if its a paid feature or whatever but I keep seeing little stickers in the about section on peoples profiles Stuff like better in person or all the drinks How do you add them because I cant seem to find them Thanks,1,226
"I hope text posts like this are allowed didnt see anything in the rules saying they arent and it is directly related to Tinder 



A while back a profile came along that had super liked me I thought they were pretty cute so I swiped right Nothing happened No match Nothing So I thought maybe they accidentally super liked and then rewound However its happened 5 more times in the past couple weeks What are the chances that this many people accidentally super liked me AND happened to be subscribed to a premium account so they could rewind I mean me being ugly enough to make people subscribe just to undo a super like is totally not off the table lol

Anyway Id say shes up to my standards and Id be interested but this might just be nothing but she still reciprocates messages so Is there any mutual interest there

Ive used tinder for years without issue Today I 23F decided to add a couple pics of my bf 23M to my profile and attempt to find us a third Pretty clean bio no sexually explicit content but got banned out of no where Quickly read the guidelines that Ive never read before cause who reads that and apparently they have a policy of one person one profile which I assume is why I got banned But hang on Ive seen hundreds of couples on tinder and turns out that cosmopolitan magazine promoted the use of tinder to find a threesome just last year So why is it my profile that is banned without warning no explanation and no option for appeals Now I cant sign up for tinder again because I cant use my phone number so I cant even use it the way I did for years without issue Honestly so frustrated at how poorly managed it is I just want my account back Anyone else experience something similar,1,887
Title says it all I matched with a girl a few months ago and never messaged her Now shes popped up again on my recent matches,1,125
So is it pointless if you dont pay to upgrade People are liking me but without goldpremium I 1 cant see who they are and 2 cant message them Is the app really this pointless and hamstrung if you just use the free version Sorry if this is dumb or obvious but Im totally out of my realm here,1,289
   I keep seeing things like this on profile and do not understand them Can anyone explain this to me,1,101
It seems as if whenever I get matches I try to break the ice ask simple questions You know blah blah blah But thats where it ends Ill ask simple questions like hows your day what you looking for out of tinder and other basic questions Thats where the messages stop Do women not like questions Am I saying something wrong Help,1,325
"Was on Tinder for a year took a break and came back in Juneand have again deleted last night

I was very honest in my profile first 2 lines Retired from commitment after 25 years not looking for more than FWB NSA etc I am not interested in an exclusive committed relationship at this time

I met 3 people last summer and all three fell in love by the second date One of them let me know she loved me about 15 minutes after we had sex I reminded each one about what my profile said how I had made it clear my intentions and that they had told me they had the same intentions 

What the high holy fuck is going on Last time I was single I was 18 Im 44 now and I thought the whole blind falling in love w someone I met for sex 30 minutes ago was a teenager thing that went away when no longer teenagers 

I finally got some feedback from someone and I was told Im being misleading with the amount of passion I put into having sex I can cook clean have all my teeth and hair this was something they said out loud lol and therefore because Im as passionate as I am Im giving people the impression that I want more

I see people on Tinder looking for everything from anal to wedding bellshas anyone determined which demographic this app is designed for

Did I just get told You need to be more of an asshole

AND WHY DO PEOPLE PUT THEIR KIDS PHOTOS ON TINDER",1,1352
So I just lost my whole account and all my matchesmessages somehow Cleared my cache in Chrome and then it logged me out When I logged back in boom blank account Anyone know what to do Thanks,1,190
So tldr I found myself matching with someone at 1am and my profile says Im looking for something casual hookups now heres where it gets interesting we talk and I throw in a dad joke and somehow it ends up with me getting her snap and us talking and so she asked for a live selfie with a filter Ill admit Im a little paranoid since people on snap have ranged from trying to extort money to promoting pages so Is it just me or did I somehow end up lucky,1,451
I feel like I can have nice conversations there with another girl but after the time runs out I hit like and then the screen just glitches and goes black So I feel like its not going through or something which lowkey sucks cause the conversations were good and Id want to match with them lmao Could just be they not liking back which is totally possible but I was just if it was a bug,1,384
I dont take it personally but Im genuinely curious as to why some girls will agree to go on a date but never follow through after I ask for the number Would you rather keep the conversation on tinder or are you just not actually serious about meeting up,1,253
"Im definitely gonna get slammed for this but its a bad idea to put naked pictures on tinder isnt it  

How the heck do I write a bio that says I just want sex  

And how would I maximize my chances of matching

How do I avoid coming off as creepy

How do I steer a conversation towards Hey I just wanna have sex how about you",1,325
So I was wondering if I could get some opinions on this topic Why is it that people on this app and dating apps in general make their bios in a way that portrays that certain person in such a shitty light Im a straight dude and all I see of women are Im such a fucking bitch or  Im toxic and have daddy issues I assume its the same for women as well When did this trend start Can someone who does this shit please explain your rationale behind the creation of such a bio I understand that people sometimes try to be funny as do I in my bio but this seems to advance to another level and Im genuinely confused as to why,1,618
Im literally not getting any matches for about a year and Im decent looking its getting silly I stopped paying for these apps because I wasnt getting any matches and I have no women in my workplace or anything Im really lost,1,224
"26M I have a mild physical disability Ive found it best to mention it in my profile so as to avoid closed minded people

After my explanation I have a joke about it to let potential matches know that it doesnt hinder my quality of life plus thats just the sense of humor I have

Maybe a joke isnt the best way to broach the topic 

If you were swiping on me how would you want to be informed",1,391
Is there a tinder service I can contact so I can make my account or behavior better suited for the app or am I just at risk of being banned whenever,1,148
So Im going to admit that I am very new to tinder and am not very good with conversations However this one girl I was messaging asked for my best pickup line and after I sent it she simply replied oh smooth Like I said Im not good at conversations how would I go about replying to it,1,283
"I had a first date with a girl last night I chose a nice bar and in terms of setting it was really good The girl and I got on pretty well and we had fun However a few of her comments bothered me

Firstly she asked me what degree I had studied and then critised my degree for not being as hard as what she studies She also mentioned that she was late for the date because she was feeling tired and not up for it Another comment was that she didnt like online dating and wish she could meet people in person Kind of weird thing to say on tinder date

At the end she said she would invite me back but she lives far away from me so wouldnt make sense She also said she would kiss me if we werent wearing masks I wasnt pushing for anything to happen so was a bit confused by those comments

Curious what other people think She was keen for another date but having my doubts if shes all that serious about it  Maybe I should focus efforts elsewhere",1,942
"Mya West aka PlaymateTessi  the girl who went virial for making fun of a cancer patient is from the Woodlands and is currently using Tinder to trollbully her matches live on stream to her viewers  She has been doing this over the past week and it looks like it maybe a reoccurring thing for content

Just a heads up  I believe the name she is using on Tinder is Kathrine

"First day I got back to the country a few weeks ago I had 66 matches the first night I went out I spoke to a few and went on dates with a few Anyway after this initial night I went back on and tried swiping Had no matches but ok whatever I just didnt have luck that day Went on the following day had nothing again but it was the same people in the same order from what I can remember I tried this 34 times and every time it was the exact same people I know if someone says no on you theyll appear for you again so thought maybe my luck had just run out Anyway I eventually found one of my friends on tinder who was in the same room as me at the time I swiped her as I do with all my friends and told her She went on and found me in 5 minutes then she swiped yes on me too and no match Weird as we had both said yes on each other 

For the last couple of weeks Ive been seeing the same people over and over again Then that annoying gold advert they have with the blurred out image of someone who likes you they gave me that all the time like way too much almost glitch levels or something Ive been on tinder for years I know the frequency of the adverts something changed then I realised my subscription was up in a couple of weeks so they were spamming the fuck out of me with adverts Anyway this gold advert appeared of a blurred out girl with bright purple hair in front of a bright yellow car Even blurred it was soooo obvious it was her and Id grown familiar to her profile as I saw it every single day for weeks It said she had liked me and I had been liking her every time I saw her But still no match 

I emailed them to say theyve obviously shadowbanned or something and provided proof of the thing with me and my friend liking each other with no match Also seeing as Im paying for it Id like my account to be reinstated or Id like my money back I got an email back about a week later saying Ive had a look at the account theres nothing wrong with it 20 mins later I had been perma banned with no explanation and I cant even contact them haha Fuck you tinder I paid for you for years and you just lost a customer to the rivals Idiots 

I hadnt spoken to a girl on there for weeks My matches on the first night back just dropped their numbers and we did it on WhatsApp plus I speak with respect so I know Ive not been banned for harassment or any of that shit Anyone ever had anything similar",1,2399

Im not looking for anything serious myself a long term hookup is ideal or even one night would be cool

Right now I get maybe 1 match a week so Im not going to loose much by trying to be up front

TLDR testing if making my intentions clear will give better results",1,692

"Decided to see what the other side was all about and turned on the women option on Tinder In 12 hours I got two matches TWO I was honestly shocked To be clear I dont think Im some godly goodlooking dude But Im decent I never have a problem getting dates have more matches than I could ever respond to in a lifetime and generally am found to be attractive I never get turned down for sex

Ive never dated a woman dont really have any desire to But my straight friends all tell me how difficult it is for them to get matches on apps I never understood it because I think they are attractive and would certainly swipe right But now I understand

So what gives Are women just less generous with their right swipes or am I missing something",1,735

I think the number one lesson Ive learned from online dating is that women are too picky and men arent picky enough Maybe Tinder and other dating apps should find ways to incentivize women to swipe right more often and incentivize men to be more discerning on who they swipe on I think this might improve everyones experience,1,325

Every day its the same routine Wake up Clean up Apply for a job or two Sleep Repeat Unfortunately Im broke cause all the money I made during college years got spent last year I want to break the cycle I kind of need to rebuild my social abilities to where it was during the early college years Well any and all good looks I may have had got slashed when my hair started going

"I live in Japan Im back on the market so naturally I tried a couple of apps to check how things are

There has been a big push for Tinder in Japan for the past few years with massive advertising and new regulations when using the app here One of them is the requirement to send governmentissued ID to prove your age before you can talk with anyone

Last time I was just when they started making those big changes

I tried yesterday and it was something completely different Now you only have Japanese users on the platform

You may think this is normal but there was a decent amount of foreigners on there before with several profiles in Japanese and in English sometimes other languages

Yesterday there were only Japanese girls I swiped hundreds of times and there was absolutely no one of foreign nationality All the profiles were exclusively written in Japanese except twice when I read a bilingual profile

I thought it was just me but then today I tried to log in and to my surprise I got banned All I got were two likes I messaged no one I have only uploaded three photos of my face and sent a picture proof to have my profile verified

Of course the support team will never give you an explanation or an appeal process giving you only a boilerplate response just as bad as a silent treatment I have requested they delete my account but I expect to get a reply saying they cant

"I could have been done with these stupid apps but unfortunantly the one group of females I am not attracted to are the only ones I seem to be able to get matches who actually also respond and seem serious

Using passport is the only time I have any success aka lots of attractive matches",1,287
"I wish I had evidence but since I was unmatched I dont have a chat log So full disclosure no evidence

Bit ranty but mostly looking for answers

TLDR Matched with someone I had a genuinely fun conversation with Things progressed well and they suggested to meet up We set a date time and location but 4 hours before they let me know they cant make it When I offered to reschedule to a better date and time they unexpectedly vanished

This isnt the first time its happened to me but its the most baffling so far I ended up matching with this person Person A and we ended up having a pretty genuine and fun conversation Started with a prompt in their bio that I was not expecting a response to but they responded Not only responded but we ended up having a light yet fun talk We had shared interests and could talk at length about it Both of us were artists and had similar tastes in shows Eventually this conversation naturally led to us setting a date time and location to meet We even made sure to agree to check in the day of to confirm All the lights were green Honestly I was super excited things have never gone so well before I even looked into the menu of the spot we would go to Tonight was the night I was confident and happily anticipating a night 4 hours before the time I sent a message to confirm if we were still good for tonight They responded that they could not meet Understandable so I offered to reschedule to a different date and time based on their schedule 

No response checked to see if Tinder didnt send the notification their profile was gone from my match list Trust me not hard to notice not much activity This situation isnt unfamiliar to me even just this year alone I can think of 2 other instances and overall its a pretty consistent occurrence

I have no clue why though Id understand if I was super rude or disinterested or not responsive or even overly responsive and over eager But it was a fair give and take Person A proposed the meeting and took the initiative there I took the initiative to check in Kept conversations even didnt do or say more than needed threw out some jokes and got some laughs We were vibing Yet once again disappeared before the meeting or shortly after in one instance But with this one everything went so well Im definitely still feeling a bit upset especially when I made the right plays but it still doesnt work out 

Thanks for reading this long post What do you all think Is there a clear reason this has happened to me especially more than once What should I do differently Was there a clear misplay Was this completely out of my hand Has all of those similar situations also been out of my hand Do you have a similar experience Have you been on either side Im mainly looking for information and ways to improve in the dating scene Everything and anything helps",1,2829
"I have been using Tinder Gold for 3 months and have about 130 matches I have a good profile I try to focus on the matches that are replying

Does anyone else have a terrible conversion rate As far as meeting Im probably on around 3

Like many of us guys I simply have almost no interaction with women on a daily basis due to work Hence why I use the app

I also find that most dates are cancelled at the last minute or they ghost me once something has been arranged unless I am constantly texting then until the very moment I am in front of them

Any advice on meeting face to face",1,581
"So I LITERALLY did nothing wrong and was just banned Not only that you cant even make an appeal The only thing I can think of is that my ex who I swiped LEFT on reported me out of spite Swiped left and within 20 minutes I was banned Also made purchases through them two days ago so there goes my money Absolute joke

My account is not able to get any likes or matches and its been a bit of a bummer Is there a way to get past the ban or if I just wait it out it will maybe go away,1,163

"Can you only message people of youve matched with them 

Can you match with someone of you dont have tinder gold Is it worth it to get tinder gold 

Without gold theres a limited number of likes When does it replenish

I am recently out of college and super into sports especially college sports Whenever I am swiping on people and I notice that the profile has the education of the rival school I automatically swipe left it doesnt matter how cute the girl is interests or anything always an automatic left swipe Is it weird to have the school someone attended be a deal breaker for me,1,367
"My first match in I dont know how long shes cool and we get along well until SHE IS A FUCKING ANTIVAXXER

"Like if after a week or a month of deletion you decide to hop on again A pic or two is the same and youre using your same phone number 

When remaking a tinder account does the app remember how well or poorly you did the last time you were using it Previously you were either cleaning up or you never got any matches and you plummeted to the bottom of peoples queues does the app keep track of this and then show you to either many or very few people accordingly

hope this makes sense",1,485
i need advice i opened my tinder say a month ago got some matches it dried up so i closed it and opened another one it has similar content to the old one but i get far less likes and matches how does that happen its weird is tinder hiding my acc because of that or whats going on,1,279

Ive been on tinder for a long long time and on multiple occasions guys have asked me the following question why did you swipe right on me why did we match and I simply cannot wrap my mind around this concept Do you need a reason to swipe right on someone Does it boost your ego knowing why I find it a bit annoying tbh,1,318

About two weeks ago I decided to download the app I got 20 likes and a handful of matches in 24 hours After that I deleted my profile and the app Two weeks later I decided to download it again Same pictures and same bio Now after a full week Ive had 0 matches AND 0 likes I dont understand,1,289
"hi fellows

I am a member of an European Rotary club we are an organization that tries to connect people with diverse work backgrounds make friends and help others with humanitarian programs A trivial and interesting discussion has started during a social event about online dating and dating does writing in your bio that you are a rotarys member lead to discrimination in your daily life or in dating  Honestly I feel proud of the humanitarian work we do and I would like to write it but other members believe it is disadvantageous due to the misinformation about who we are and what we do Do you have any experiences about that",1,630
When I first started using Tinder in 2014 the app felt like this new frontier of dating There was no paid features unlimited swiping stories where people would post their nudes people werent their to advertise their onlyfans or gain Instagram followers And the conversations and dates I went on during that time people seemed like they had their guard down and easy going I think now with any app that goes the paid route theyre going to do things like limit swipes and throttle who sees your account so you have less matches and will want the paid features,1,557
Hi guys I have paid for tinder account  And I can change my location to different cities around the world I can see people then from that city and swipe left or right But my question is can these people in this city I selected also see as being around the area Or how does it work  Thanks,1,288
"Hey peeps I use tinder gold for few months now and at first I could see who liked me But recently I dont see anything However sometimes I get that message stating Someone has liked you go see who

When I check nothing is there Is it some glitch or error Or is it just Tinder grabbing attention",1,293
Has anyone found a way around this i was told if i changed my number that would work but i dont want to change my number lol,1,124

Same profile Same text Same area But far far far fewer matches Used to get about 20 in the first 24 hours and then 45 per day Now Im lucky if I get 2 a week

Im not an attractive guy Im 19 and Ive never been in a relationship Right now I dont feel like I have much to lose Ive never kissed someone and I cant even say Ive fallen in love with someone because she never felt the same way Im wondering if this is a good place to look for someone I want to meet someone genuine and Im too scared to actually ask someone out in person What would you do if you were me,1,404
So everyone I ever match with just stops talking to me Ive revamped my profile a million times tried pickup lines questions about profiles small talk had deep convos people really have seemed to enjoy talking to me but the moment I ask if they actually you know want to meet me if I even get that far just ghost me I dont understand Ive tried every approach I wanna kms,1,369
Today I went on a date The guy wanted to hook up and I didnt I was apologetic and asked to go home As soon as I got dropped off home he unadded my snap and reported my tinder for his knows what and now Im banned I know I didnt break terms of service and when I contact tinder support I get a automated message that says they arent accepting appeals to banns Stupid they even have the option to email them what a scam,1,416

"I know one good Tinder conversation is not something to simp over That being said I was talking to this girl yesterday over the course of a day and the conversation went so well that I honestly cannot fathom why she would unmatch Well she disappeared from my Tinder list when I went to talk to her today no idea why maybe she had her reason to unmatch or maybe she got kicked off Tinder or something tbh I have no idea I am by no means overly attached but we hit it off so well and got to know each other VERY well all in the course of a day but she was so cool and we had virtually identical interests across the board So I have her FB however the way I obtained it would probably suggest that I was snooping while we were talking Also if I add her then it will seem like I am needy and then it will be ruined anyway so it almost seems the only respectable way would be to just leave it alone and go our separate ways but on the otherhand part of me wants to add her Then I think that I dont want to force my way into anybodys life and maybe she just wasnt ready or decided she just wasnt that interested What do you think Should I say fuck it and add her Or should I just drop it

So I changed my phone number a few years ago I believe I might have had an active tinder account linked to my old phone number at the time I changed it Im worried someone has my old phone number as their current one and if they try to create a tinder profile it will just log them into my old account and theyll see all my personal messages My boyfriend works for a phone store and says thats impossible because phone numbers get pulled from data bases when theyre inactive is he right,1,485
Yesterday I was getting notifications of new messages and matches but neither would actually show up on the app The only way to get them to show is to delete the app off my iPhone then redownload it Still happening today Is this common and is there a way to fix it,1,264

"Scenario so Im swiping on Tinder and I come across someone who has already liked me ie a pending match If I wanted to save that match for later and carry on swiping in the stack would it be a viable move for me to save the link to their profile so that I could find and match them later on then swipe left just to carry on down the stack and obviously when I want to match said person then I could use the link to their profile and swipe right The reason Id do this is cos I dont want to match and message multiple people at once so Id rather do things one person at a time

Would this be a viableok thing to do or would it ruin anything such as ending potential matches Please let me know below thanks in advance",1,713
"See a girl I want to super like oh Im all out Ill just leave it here so I can do it tomorrow 
9 hours to go shes still there
5 hours to go still there 
1 hour to go still there 
20 minutes to go all good Ill just leave the app in the foreground to keep it there 
Check when its time to like aaand shes gone crap Ill look through the stack for her 
Looking for a while cant find her again I guess she may not get shown to me again other people come up that I want to super like 
The moment my super likes are gone there she is a few people later lol 

If this happened once Id say its coincidence but this seems to happen every time I run out of super likes and hit someone I want to super like and save for later One way around it is the share a profile with a friend thing and just sending the profile to yourself but thats just extra steps and it just seems like the whole app is dark UI patterns trying to funnel you into paying ever more even on a premium plan",1,964
"Every thousand swipes or so I see a woman Im into enough to read their bio and it says that they are a lesbian  not interested in men

So I usually disappointingly swipe left and assume that they mistakenly selected whatever option to be shown to male users

Do you guys think thats right If they were looking for male friends in most cases Id be down

Has anyone else noticed this

I guess to answer my own question here I could swipe right instead and just ask them if I match

Also potentially if there were a lesbian or two reading this who have been on the other side of this maybe they are looking for friends maybe they had the wrong setting and were surprised to be superliked by a guy they could share their perspective",1,728

"Hey all Im in a bit of a predicament This girl Ive been dating not exclusively but 3 dates now has been contradicting herself and its making my head spin We had our last date Friday and it was great The more time I spend with her the most chemistry I think we have Shes fun to be around and I see potential with her 

She commented heart faces on my most recent Instagram post FaceTimes me texts me wishing a good day in the morning when she knows Im stressed or have a lot in my mind and has gone the extra mile to show she cares about me 

I made another post earlier in the day outlining something she did the night after or date friday Basically she posted a video of her grinding on another guy amp when I saw it I replied and she said wya 

She told me Friday that she was bored of drinking and yet she goes out continuously and get shtcanned almost every day of the weekend from dusk to dawn This doesnt bother me I just find it off that she blatantly contradicts herself like that She talks a lot of trash about the people she hangs out with guys and girls yet still hangs with the same crowd who apparently drag her down and do things that she doesnt like 

I know this because she told me on Friday Yeah she not my exclusive girlfriend but I worry about this sometimes Her friend group is definitely not my crowd and one concern I have is if we dated how I would mesh with her people

The grinding video definitely made me a little upset Not that she did something wrong we arent exclusive but after seeing that literally the night after going on a date with her was not a good feeling 

I plan on messaging her tomorrow I have a message typed out It basically outlines how i enjoyed our last date want to continue to feel this out and see where it goes but seeing that video made me question whats going on and how she feels I also just want to ask to hear her out from her perspective Is this a good game plan

Any insight is appreciated This situation just had my head spinning a little",1,1999

I love the podcast since its pretty entertaining and the guys are spot on with a lot of things They even talk about dating and using apps such as tinder to increase whatever a guy is looking for Women dont really like them what I noticed probably because they expose everything wrong with what a lot of women do daily such as never taking accountability and overvaluing them selves which I notice many overvalue themselves on not only tinder but outside of it Overall recommend the podcast its dope,1,498

"I woke up to two girls askinggiving snapchats and have had multiple women in the past ask about snapchat I usually just dont respond because I dont have one anymore or dont care to make one and move on but was wondering how the yieldprogression has been for you guys Like app gt snapchat gt meetup or has it been mostly a waste of time

I think part of the snapchat thing is because women think Im a catfish I asked a girl one time why she wants my snapchat and she said its because I think youre a catfish and Ive had dates literally tell me they were nervous and had their friend waiting outside in case I was a catfish Of course the dates went fine and they were relieved when I was the person on the profile 

I dont think my profile is too crazy though mostly selfies a couple DSLRs and my bio talks about my schooldating interests which are admittedly a bit aggressive

I also know some girls just want to increase their snapchatIG followers or whatever which is what I think the second girl is going for

"Hey Reddit I need some advice Ive been talking to this girl for about 25 months now weve gone on 3 dates and have chemistry and have definitely hit it off 

Friday night we had our third date Mini golf then we went back to my place and slow danced in my living room and got smoothies It was fun We cuddled and watched a movie to end the night Ive been single for about 4 years and this girl seems pretty cool I like her company 

She comments on my photos I post and also texts me in the morning when she knows I had a bad day We arent exclusively dating yet but she had definitely gone the Extra mile to show that she cares about me 

On our date she was talking about how she doesnt like it when guys come up behind her at bars and try to get her to grind on them Last night she posted a video of her grinding on some guy and it rubbed me the wrong way Id be lying if I said it didnt bother me 

I was also out last night and was kinda drunk She replied to my story saying have funnnn and then later posted that video I swiped up and said wtf and she said whaatt and then asked where I was 

Yeah we arent dating exclusively I know that But this really does bother me especially when the tried making it sound like she didnt like that stuff The crowd she hangs with it definitely not my crowd but when Im with her shes a lot more chill and down to earth She goes out a lot with her girlfriends and some weird looking guys 

Its odd to me that she would post that the day after telling me how she didnt like that stuff Its also weird seeing that the day after I went on a date with her  

I dont know what to do I feel like i should communicate my thoughts but I dont know how to do it or what to say I dont want to screw this up but also feel like I shouldnt do nothing about it

So I never got a ton of like necessarily But I used to get a fair amount But nowadays Im not getting hardly any Ive noticed it seemed to start happening right around when that tinder platinum started showing up Is that my problem Did they make it that much harder to get likes unless you pay like that,1,301
"I usually try to open with a greeting unless their bio says to start with something they like Hi how are you and Hey whats up are along the lines of what I say I get my fair share of matches but it seems like one message is as far as it goes Am I doing something wrong or do I just have awful luck with women

"Hi theres this girl I met about 2 weeks ago whos mutual friends with a group of girls that I hang out with Shes fucking awesome and Ive been smitten ever since I first talked to her Im really nervous It feels like everyone I match with on tinder vanishes after the first few messages so I dont want to blow up my shot that same way

Whats a way to open thats casual enough to not blow my chances but interesting enough to get a response Her bio is well rounded  and her pics are of her playing softball in a chem lab and the classic holding up the Pisa tower

She has the same name as a close friend of hers so she usually goes by her last name which is one letter off from key  I was thinking I could go with some sort of pun about the key to her heart using her last name but after typing it out that feels lame

Thanks so much",1,829

I approximately swipe yes 40 of the people I ser yet got nada Do you need to be super attractive in order to get at least a match

How about you guys any luck",1,496

Some things that mightve attributed to this I bought the subscription online through the web browser It was cheaper this way I also used a VISA gift card one that didnt have enough to charge me for another month I never actually cancelled the subscription I just let it run out on its own and let Tinder keep trying to charge the card Either way Im getting all the perks of Tinder plus without paying anything Im afraid now that I have spoken my powers will disappear Has this happened to anyone else",1,807

Firstly would it be legal to meet And secondly would you consider it to be morally wrong

I wonder if its better for the algorithm if you just accept any likes you get no matter what to stay more relevant in the system Any of you got experience with this",1,476

"Hey guys I apologise in advance for sound shallow AF but Im hoping someone can give me a genuine response

A few years back I had moved abroad to Germany for a couple of years I downloaded tinder for the very first time in order to meet new people make friends and potentially for dating as well My experience was that the guys on there were crazy attractive almost modelesque and I matched with them We met some became friends others led to nowhere but I actually wound up in an 18month relationship with one gorgeous guy

I had to return to my home country as a result of the covid pandemic and my experience with Tinder back home is incredibly different Most of the profiles that come up are not even remotely as nice as the ones of guys while I was abroad Also the quality of peoples photos is pretty bad like pixelated or blurry

Why is this the case Is there a way to see more attractive people on tinder or is it a matter of me being ranked low in my home country",1,970

"I am 6 and a girl While Im in pretty good shape and am very confident with my height I often find that a lot of men are turned off by it or intimidated and air me when they find out If I meet them irl and they dont know its usually the same result especially if Im taller than then which happens often 

I dont really care about the height of my partner but Im trying to look for someone who is fine with it AND lets me wear high heels which I also wear almost daily because I like them

So my question is how can I phrase it in my bio as a warningdisclaimer and maybe something about heels without sounding rude negative or being misinterpreted as wanting a partner over 6 
Im fine being with any height partner but I dont know how to get that across too because usually when heights mentioned on tinder its because of someone looking for a specific height requirement",1,869

"I got banned from Tinder in 2018 For 6 months after the ban I was periodically getting notifications saying You have a new like

I moved to another city during that period and I saw a noticeable increase in these notifications corresponding to a larger pool of new people seeing my profile information

Tinder support completely stonewalled me when I tried to get an answer to what was going on

This put me in a terrible situation Just knowing that they were publicly showing my personal information without my concent was bad enough What if I was to start a relationship with someone It could easily become damaging to my reputation that I still had a Tinder account making it seem like I was seeking to cheat on my partner 

And there was nothing I could do about it

The behaviours of the Tinder support service is really bizzare They keep refusing to even begin anwer any questions I have about this situation They for the most part copy and paste boiler plate code about me being banned They dont address my questions at all

One of the few times they actually typed some words to me they told me You can go ahead and delete the app now I read that as Please delete the app so you dont notice that we dont have control of this situation

I am pleased to announce that I filed a BBB complaint against Tinder for banning my account for no good reason and the complaint actually forced Tinder to respond Today they wrote to say it was a technical error and my profile is now restored to all its former glory I honestly never thought it would work and it took several weeks of waiting Naturally I lost the matches I was most interested in since it appeared to them like I just straight ghosted in the middle of a convo weeks ago And tbh I feel like just deleting the app again anyway After all that time off I realized I felt better without online dating in my life and had pretty much moved on But scoring the FU to Tinder made the small amount of effort worth it to file the complaint so I recommend it to all the other people that Tinder does this to on a regular basis,1,830

There isnt a step by step guide that applies to all situations but reading a written statement that doesnt admit wrongdoing and in fact blames it on growing up in a time and place where it turns out racism wasnt NEARLY as bad as elsewhere and then writing it off as over it not the right way to do it

While I grew out of wrestling in high school I was a BIG fan in the Hulksters golden age and it sucks that he refuses to change and learn Making mistakes  even big ones  isnt reason to write someone off but not admitting to the mistakes means he could very easily repeat it or is currently repeating it but just doing it in secret now

"Im not necessarily making a value judgement as to ehether being friends with your exes is good or bad Its neither Its completely contextual though and you  as well as those that agreed with you  paint the dynamic with a broad dismissive brush of being friends with your exes means youre mature and progressive 

And youre already walking it back from your original position by adding the qualifier of possible for all parties

Break ups happen for sure I dont get hung up on it or hold a grudge but im not friends with any of my exes  doesnt matter if i broke up with them them with me or it was amicable Its just not worthwhile in my experience

Most people cant stay in a healthy friendship with their exes and in my opinion its for good reason I was with X person because i liked them as a person and their character yes but it was also because of that romantic interest 

And I would wager that most people that say they are friends with their exes moreso mean theyre friendly  i dont know many people that could frequently hangout their ex without being in the position of either fuck i miss us or fuck theyre catching feelings again

So to conclude theres nothing wrong with it I just think its not possible or realistic in most situations and acting as if it is is blissful ignorance at best or at worst straight up terrible advice",1,1338

"I found tinder plus and gold to be shit and worthless What worked for me was Platinum Best money spent ever The huge difference is that you will appear almost at the top of the deck of the people who you have swiped right   
I will copy paste what I replied to somebody else in another post  
You can get matches and have sex being an average man on tinder If you want to get there fast pick good pictures write an interestingfunny profile and buy Platinum  
I did the first two and got 3 matches in a week and 20 likes I worked really hard on my profile I even roasted my profile in httpsroastdating and also put my profile in the rtinder section of asking for profile advice Then I bought Platinum It was a Friday night and in 12 hours I got 10 matches after swiping for 1 hour I dont know if that is a lot or not when using Platinum a Friday night at 10 pm But it definitely worked for me I didnt think I would get a date on the same weekend but on Sunday night I went out with one of them and had a great time

I actually found out once I started being pickier on that app two things happened  1 My average of likes didnt really change too muchdont worry it was still small Im not in the shape to be doing shirtless selfies nor am I Chiseled Chin Chad and by me being a little more selective a lot of that switched the ball over to my court and I found that by being more selective I didnt grow as tired of the process

Talking about my profile when I had one I did get a good amount of matches with a different philosophy in my bio I like to expose some thoughts of mine even political ones so that I can find people who relate to that I believe generic bios meant to please all kind of people end up making no one relate to them Ok Ill never get a match with a girl who supports Trump but the ones that deslike him are more likely to pass me to the right And the other benefit is that even if I could get match from Trumpist girls there wouldnt be a connection in the conversation anyway so whats the point I know I went a bit off topic but I see so much generic and embrancing bios that kept me thinking about that",1,923

"Im not overthinking its just that those kind of behaviours are so implicit that look like theyre fine while theyre built over sexism

Anyway I see Tinder as a one more chance to meet girls Also the app itself works by both parties showing interest for eachother which means the app puts both on the same level

So thats why IMHO if you trigger the match text first cause its fkin weird to be online leave a like get the its a match thingy and then vanish the hell out waiting for the other person to write",1,505
Its not a joke,1,14
Cat fish definitely,1,19
Rule number 1 about dating and getting laid tips is never ever take advice about it from a woman Logically it makes sense but they have even less of a clue than you do,1,167
It depends on where you are and what kinda radio towers are nearby My phone use 5g 99 of the time but sometimes when i visit the countryside or low pop islands there is no other choice but 3G4G,1,193

"Nope Working out is healthy especially for skinny people Gotta get muscle and stay in shape 

Everyone and I mean everyone should work out and exercise Talk to your doctor hell say the same",1,189
"Personally sounds like you should take a couple months off the app 

What you should do instead is get out more find a hobby now that covid restrictions are opening in the US find a new friend group and hopefully they can help you meet someone 

I picked up some new hobbies took a break from the app and then when I came back a couple months later I found my current girlfriend You cant force it Just invest in yourself and find a way to make yourself happy without someone else",1,479

"If you dont want to work out youre allowed to Theyre living for themselves 
Would it be good for them to stop being overweight sure like itd be good for people to stop casually drinking and me to stop eating ramen noodles at lunch or splurging my money on stupid anime merch

But do I want to
This question makes all the difference
If yes sure Im living for myself if I stop
If No then Im simply listening to others

Youre preaching to someone who doesnt even need to work out most people can throw me father than they can trust me 
The sad part is that your entire argument rides on me being overweight and after I disclose the information that Im not you wont have shit to say
Youve completely fabricated my appearance in your mind and you need it to be true so you for nothing more than your own insecurities



Yeah tskkk yikes",1,831
"Yeah i get it but this is a numbers game  Woman has 500 matches guy has 5  If all guys are using the same opener cheesy clever pickup line they got from reddit she gets 450490 of those So yeah shes probably not interested  

Tinder is driven by looks  If youre top 5 hot she responds differently  But if youre borderline you just basically show up as a basic Brad when you use those lines  

If i had the answer on how to differentiate yourself on tinder id be a millionaire but at least we all should be self aware enough to stop using whats not working",1,554

"Ask yourself what do you want to show

I dont Want to be harsh but right now its one photo with a mask one photo with a weird angle and a description that let the reader think money is all that makes you interesting Its not very appealing


Dont try to be clever or witty or to boast about something in your bio just give either an honest description about who you are or a funny anecdote to help the ladies start a conversation it will be more than enough


Also dont be afraid to take a regular picture of yourself waist up with nothing weird in the background a good background would be ideal if you cant have that just stand against a wall
Ideally add a picture of yourself doing something you love whether its practicing a sport or cooking and all should be fine",1,767

Can we not find a better example already

And again this is all semantics and there are thousands of examples of semantic differences between academic definitions and common usage definitions of words Which ones you choose to make battles out of are going to define peoples opinions of your character

If you want to call a black person being shitty to a white person that didnt do anything to them racism sure go ahead But if you want to spend hours in discussions trying to convince everyone that some black people being jerks to white people and the machine of institutional racism spoiling countless generations of peoples lives are basically the same thing then youve made a decision to be regressive and unhelpful and youre making sure others notice that

 You could potentially improve the variety of types of photos This articlehttpshovalocomonlinedatingtakingphotostinderpics goes talks about the different types you can take  
 A small group photo is ideal for your online dating profile it shows that you have an active social life  
 The number of photos in your profile is very low I suggest you add more pictures Having a minimum of 5 or 6 photos is ideal for Tinder   
 You might want to improve the quality of your photos since poorquality images are something you need to avoid on dating apps

Women prefer plausible deniability even if they want to have sex with you they will reject you if you outright ask for it or mention it however if you hint towards it by for example inviting her to your house to hang out or any other masking activity even though its obvious your intentions are to sleep with her she will go along with it because its what she wants in the end anyways women prefer there experience to be similar to that of a good book and no good book with just a front and back cover is any good you need the story that goes between even if you both want the same ending,1,588

"gtOk ok I need to proofread more

To be fair this is reddit I honestly probably made a few mistakes myself it just stuck out because it was the first word in the comment

gtIts as much as study as underwater basketweaving is If you dont get a governmentpaid research job your degree is functionally useless No one is interested in research on these topics

Except not all research has to be government funded to be viable but I do agree that most people who get those degrees arent ever actually going to use them and that better decisions could be made there And in fact a lot of research into these topics are government funded since the government is the ones who take action for more inclusivity Its just the degree of what they do thats lead to a lot of backlash

gtFor foreign problems yes there were colonies and exploitations But all these countries have been paid hundreds of billions in aid and support over the decades Its time that these countries start to take responsibility for their current state When does the fingerpointing end And where does it start Can the UK blame Italy for Roman conquest of Britain Do they have a right to reparations or aid

Hundreds of billions is no match for the amount of damage that Britain did Its estimated that the British took 45 trillion from India as well as fucked up its infrastructure massively The point about the Roman conquest of Britain is such a false equivalence since the country didnt go back to good as soon as the conquest ended To put it in perspective my Grandpa was alive when the British were still in control of India its less than 1 life time ago Obviously theres issues in India that come from itself Im not denying that But what I am saying is that the British had much more effect in Indias current climate than you think and thats true for many other countries that were colonized not just by British mind you The whole reason I brought this up is because you said that Countries and neighbourhoods with majority black population do worse in literally every aspect even if they have massive advantages in natural resources which isnt true

gtMaybe the people you know but the statistics are absolutely not in agreement with you The forbidden four numbers are actually based on reality And yes I agree that the US police seems absolutely despicable at times But also here this does not absolve you of your own responsibility One can wonder why they have so many interactions with police at all

One can wonder why they have so many interactions with police at all If one wonders this they clearly havent read enough into the topics This is a huge part of systemic racisms over policing of communities Im not the type to say all cops are racist or that ACAB but you cant deny that a lot of personal bias gets put into police interactions 

Now imagine this the government puts less resource into ares that have a majority of black and brown people This leads to less education and less opportunities On top of that at least earlier in the US the government also pushed drugs onto those communities Now they can send police to sit around there more often and try to arrest people in those communities even planting evidence Those people who were arrested even if on bogus charges are now in a position where they dont have the same community support due to lack of government funding for infrastructure in those areas and have a harder time finding a job because of a false arrest 

That isnt true for every interaction Sometimes the people arrested deserve it sometimes they dont for another reason But by underfunding communities and making it harder for people to climb up it gives police a false justification to over police and continues a cycle like this Theres more examples of this but my tired brain isnt going to remember them without going back to notes


gtAny chance of reform has been blown The entire support for blacks has absolutely disintegrated People saw BLM as a justified outrage for basically a murder Now it is a looting rioting band of the very people who want to destroy your city out of boredom and for fun without any repercussions There was a chance for reform and it is absolutely blown

93 of protest were completely peaceful Many of the nonpeaceful protest were turned violent due to either cops false flags or people who dont care about the cause taking advantage of it I agree that the people who rioted looted and burned things down are completely abhorrent but I also know they dont represent that cause The people who want reform are not the same people who took advantage of these situations and many I know personally dont support it But even then this is a replay of the civil rights movement including the violence which lead to a proper reform and more rights for minority communities I believe that reform is still coming but I also dont stand with the people using a political movement for personal gain and destruction

 Finished University with a degree in Computer Science with a minor in politics and music ethnology studying the effects of politics on music and viseversa Im not an expert in any of these topics but its stuff Ive extensively read about and have taken a lot of notes on these topics I work in tech but I still find politics interesting and too important to not study",1,5304

 Try to use different types of photos in your profile Check out this guidehttpshovalocomonlinedatingtakingphotostinderpics for some inspiration  
 Try to stick with one group photo You can add another one if the quality is really good and you look great on both Avoid looking like the underdog of the group  
 You need to remove some pictures from your profile Try to not exceed 6  
 Some pictures can be made more attractive by editing brightness cropping and color balance among other adjustments  
 I recommend you use different outfits and locations for each photo Doing the opposite can affect your matching ratio

Back when Tinder first started it was roughly 5050 men and women and mostly adventurous party women dtf Super easy to get matches and get laid Then the creepy loner dudes found it and completely ruined the app scaring off a lot of women those women now just hook up through snap chat and insta dms Tinder is now 75 men and most of the women are super picky and dont meet up very often That combined with people are better at taking social media pictures and faking a persona online that leads to extreme competition on the male side Unless you are very talented with presenting yourself online or are very attractive you are going to have a tough time on Tinder as a man,1,670

"Youre REALLY over estimating how dangerous and common STDs are  Theyre out there but if you use a condom which you should and make sure your partner has been tested recently which you should youre running a VERY low risk  If you do happen to get something its probably going to be easy to cure or easy enough to manage

Its like driving a car  Wear a seatbelt and pay attention when youre driving  Avoid the riskiest situations and use your best judgement  If you do all this which isnt even that much tbh then your odds of having a good time behind the wheel are pretty good

Your post history is a fucking mess dude  You need to worry about just having very small light conversations with people especially women before you worry about catching STDs from kissing strangers on the mouth",1,787

"gt Youre genderafricanetc studies hobbyists dont count as actual research buddy These people are simple looking to deflect blame and ask for more handouts

First of all Your 

Secondly what merit do you have to say they dont count You cant just dismiss an entire field of study because you think theyre just looking for handouts Especially when the studies look at both the cause and effect of different events and how theyve effected the communities as a way of trying to figure out and repair the damage done to those communities 

gtThese communities bring themself down There is absolutely no influence necessary to do that Countries and neighbourhoods with majority black population do worse in literally every aspect even if they have massive advantages in natural resources I assume the wypipo are to blame for this as well

These communities do have some blame but theres so much more to it than just that If you ever actually picked up a history book or actually looked into the topics more Im sure your opinion would change Theres literally proof that the US government pushed crack onto black and brown communities to keep them down And looking at other countries shows nothing when so many countries were colonized and had their resources taken away India with its resources would have been one of the richest countries today if it wasnt for the British Raj who literally took away so much food from the people that there were 12 famines all while they had record food exports All this stuff still has effects today

gtI am absolutely in favor of people building a life here I am an expat myself I live everywhere I have however not once been arrested I have a job and pay taxes If you cant do that I would really like you to leave It is absurd that is a racisct standpoint these days

Most people I know in these communities have jobs pay taxes and havent been arrested But even not being arrested isnt something to look at when its been proven that minority communities have had 1 False arrest with planted evidence seen more often with body cams now but even then we cant see the full extent 2 Are policed harder than other communities 3 Usually are treated less than fair in court No one saying that paying taxes and having a job is racist People are just saying that regardless of race they want to be treated completely fairly And for that to properly happen there needs to be more reform",1,2406

Lets instead focus our efforts on telling all those women how ashamed they should be for the actual real crime of not endangering themselves more and for not coddling shitty men even more than they already do Lets get our priorities straight for a change and fix the real social problems and traumas that people are experiencing",1,846

"Hey bro

ampx200B

Bio pretty good but dont put the height line Its a big trap Many guys fall for that sayinggirls only wan tall men Thats super wrong They want confident men And often short guys are not regarding size

That being said here are my takes for your pics

 Dont use sunglasses It hides you a lot 

 Vodka mix pic you dont stand out enough The same with you alone and the ingredients would be way better

 Avoid selfies the cow selfie is very random Replace by a relaxed portrait  way better

 Beach selfie  a bit the same

 Classroom blurry low quality and too close body language

 Last pic very good but the closed body language and sunnies

You have a lot of things you can change to quickly get better results

12 good relaxed full body pics 12 portraits and youll be way better

Okay so as a woman who is friends with lots of women and is quite successful on tinder I disagree with the comments saying hiking is a mans hobby and its the equivalent to girls saying they like shopping Um no PLENTY of women love hiking and nature and scaling mountain tops I think the bio is funny and cute I would not change it In fact I see hiking is something you can pick as one of your 5 words on your profile and I see a lot of women who have that in their bio along with a lot of men who have it in their bio so mentioning hiking and outdoors is completely fine and will still attract women Maybe Im just angry at the comments Bc of the sexism I faced as a woman geologist who loves hiking but saying its like women liking shopping got me mad Ugh,1,755

Also a tip for men is to go to the bar sooner as dudes tempt to arrive later than girls and pretty girls tempt to leave sooner as they attract drunkies the most P Also as the summer arrives you can occupy the best terrace places and strategically put yourself in the middle so that you will have many drunk people around later to interact with P",1,700

4 He called her on her nonsense
5 Rather than take any sort of responsibility and move on she went into rationalization mode and decided hes a creep because calling someone a creep due to age gap is typically a socially bulletproof way to dodge accountability and gain social sympathy

You cant have opinions about what other people do tho If they arent breaking the law it is not your business There is no right or wrong when it comes to who we couple with only personal preferences But this person is saying that two particular types of genes are universally wrong to pair together and thats when it gets disturbingly racist,1,340

Ive read into it it also shows you to people that have swiped on you it blurs out their profile picture so you cant see what they look like while chatting Once its over you get the choice to swipe or not still without seeing them Its essentially blind dating,1,258

I dont think its that weird thats like disliking aggressively hetero dudebros,1,77
"Im bisexual and have frequented dating apps Some are better than others Men are 1000x weirder by far

"If it makes you feel worse Im ugly and I still got 250 matches in my unpopulated area within 15 years

If it makes you feel better I was on Tinder for 15 years and all I got was boobs on my face once",1,199
Oh no the way I was thinking is the score is for your personality So you just add or subtract from your general character,1,121
Why are we saying only one goat pic  Keep the goat pics If nonmonogamy was for me youd have been swiped right by me  Looks great  goats and all,1,143
Touch if the tar brush lt learned that from a comedy routine,1,60
If a couple isnt breaking any laws then no one has a right to say they shouldnt be together just because of their physical traits  If one cheats on the other or one beats them then sure you can say they shouldnt be together But saying something like People with blonde hair and people with freckles dont belong together is a very baseless and dangerous way of thinking It boarders on eugenics and is not acceptable,1,414
"Not gonna lie Id swipe left The following add up to iffy for me

 Multiple pictures from the same photoshoot

 Vaping picture

 Almost no text


Frankly I think the biggest issue is that your profile seems like the profile of a really boring dude I know basically nothing about you after seeing these photos and reading that profile I dont know what your passions are what you do for fun what your humour is like Thats part of why the vaping picture is so bad  I dont wanna date a dude who has vaping as his only marketable hobby

Good things that you should build on

 The umbrella picture Its silly and gives me a slight sense of your humour

 The first picture It says you kinda like culturepretty buildings and its just a nice photo

 The Libra thing I personally would swipe left on that but Im assuming you put it there because you want a girl for whom its meaningful Thats exactly how you should think Figure out what matters to you what kinda person you are and who you wanna attract and put THOSE things in your profile",1,1028

gtYou have to take new pictures preferably with a friend Or at least get a tripod for your phone and then use the timer  
gt  
gtJust use the simple formular 1 Portrait 2 Body 3 Social 4 Hobby  
gt  
gtSo for example  
gt  
gt1 Picture of your face with visible shoulders preferably with a smile  
gt  
gt2 A picture of your whole body preferably good clothes  
gt  
gt3 A picture during a social gathering eg you holding some cards and laughing at a joke or you at a picknick you get the point

"Privet bratan

Good vibe in your profile

 You have room to improve but already do some cool stuffs Good smiling and relaxed attitude on the stairs for instance

 Main issue we dont see you very CLEARLY on your profile

 First pic in a restaurant we dont see your eyes Could be ok but holding you back

You need a portrait like that with your eyes

 Cropped out pic  of you looking mean not great to crop

 Snowboard would be way better with motion Lighting isnt great

 Paintball same good action but you are masked Its ok if we see you before here no

 With the tie you look way too stiff Fake smile dump

 Stairs ok pose but the quality is low Dont crop inside tinder

So to summarize work on this add at least one portrait and one full body pic standing relaxed Youll have way better results

Also checkout this profile review apphttpsroastdating Should give you great tips too

"I mean its all a little arbitrary and definitely depends on context  In the US if you refer to someone as a person of color thats acceptable or even preferred and if you say colored person you sound like someone from the 1950s Its not even that colored person was derogatory After all one of the most important civil rights advocacy groups was the NAACP The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People But people who still say colored person or colored people or that someone is colored have usually been living under a rock when it comes to racial politics 

I imagine that what is normal in the American context doesnt map onto the French one and viceversa At the end of the day if you use whatever is considered polite currently people are far more likely to listen to the content of what you say",1,814
I dont know if youre joking or racist,1,37
Smooth like butter,1,18
"The fact that it cant predict exact events is the point Literally everyone has good and bad periods in life Everyones has life changing periods it not unique to you Saying that life changing events are going to happen without giving any detail about their nature or timeframe down to at least the month is not a prediction I predict that youll have a hard time in the next few years with a relationship I predict that work will do stressful for you soon For most people those will turn out to be true Sheer probability
And predictions fail all the time you just never hear people ravingabout how a vague events didnt happen",1,623
Its very simple For most if there is some visual mix in you theyd assume youre black and thats it,1,97
I wasnt asking this seriously Saying punchlines before set ups working hella backwards and pretty much kills the joke Should have said I dont think she laughed,1,159
White women do not belong with black dudes Feels like a pretty generic statement about race mixing,1,98
Why do so many women seem to hate fishing Lol,1,45
"gtI think theres a big difference between Id date a black person if I felt the attraction but I havent and races shouldnt mix Im not a mudshark

Your bio needs work too Include some information about what you dothings you like etc so people can get an idea about who you are It also gives them an easier way to start a convo if you did match

Also as someone else said lose the vape pic",1,464
I really dont know how did this work ngl,1,40
HAHA Im kinda being sarcastic I know its bad but dude thats genius I love it,1,76
Notice how she said the darks and not Im not attracted to black people This gives anyone with a brain the instant realization that she is racist We never said that you arent allowed to not be attracted to certain races but to isolate and demean them to the point where the darks is how youd refer to a race of PEOPLE speaks volumes to how she views us,1,351
Just like tinder,1,16
Are you swiping on them for fun or to actually hook up with them 50 guys looking for young women are only really gonna be scum bags,1,131
"For me woman met my boyfriend of 3 years on tinder I would have been hesitant due to the lack of descriptive text in your bio Especially since the only text says that youre looking for something real It come across a bit like you mainly put text there cause you had to I had three things that would give a definite no on tinder 1 no pictures of his face 2no picture where hes smiling 3 No bio text And youre borderline on the last criteria

Obviously not everyone thinks like me And it is possible that I was wrong in how I used Tinder But it worked for us",1,556
"1 Astrology cannot predict exact events It predicts good and bad periods in life
2 I wasnt impressed by some simple good and bad things The good and bad things were really really big stuff lifealtering level stuff
3 Also if youre saying that telling someone that somethings going to happen is not a prediction but a probability then please tell me what you would call it if someone predicts all big life events back to back very correctly according to the time and they havent even met me or even seen me they werent even given my name
You might call it a prediction but when someones predictions NEVER fail theres got to be something Or even if theres nothing and they are the best at predictions even then Im sold because they are always right",1,745
No thats for a vegan only hospital,1,34
"No but it seemed to work I guess so lets go

My reply would be Its impolite to kiss and tell did your friends not teach you that Or something along those lines


Good luck",1,171
Youre answering your own question The answers are vague because that is the nature of astrology There is never any detail in the answers given Theyre made to be vague to they apply to the majority of people The point it that people associate themselves with a sign and claim the traits attributed to it and when told that the traits and events from a completely different sign actually pertains to theirs they agree that it applies to them  because of how vague the answers are and how theyre designed to apply to everyone,1,522

Valid argument Albeit a lie I love variety,1,42
That isnt racist in itself in the same way as being hetero doesnt make you homophobic What makes her racist however is the manner she speaks in,1,143
Okay that wasnt shitty is it was evil,1,37
Yeah the language she used before was really racist thats true,1,62
Agreed normal is boring,1,23
I think its ironic how you basically respond like youre reading from a script and are asking for me to put in effort for you who doesnt have any intention to consider reality It doesnt matter what I tell you because you either refuse or are unable to process nuance,1,265
Demanding evidence is not unreasonable for something that claims to be able to predict how your life will turn out so people life theirs in accordance with those predictions And the evidence to the contrary has already been stated A quick Google search will clue you in,1,269
"Seems to be working
Maybe follow with a Im looking for quality instead of quantity kinda thing",1,94
Thats completely fine Referring to PoC as the darks is not,1,58
I just not looking for to being single,1,38
And Im quite certain these events were extremely vague with no detail attached to them whatsoever Which is how they get you Everyone has good and bad things happen in their life Telling someone theyre going to happen isnt a prediction is probability and that probability is extremely high,1,288
What do you think they could possibly to not sound like a racist shit,1,69
Fair enough I do recommend switching it up I did travel as well and found the benefit negligible and ultimately just a waste of money but if it works for you go ahead,1,166

"Im not really sure what you think your point is here  Cops may well be shitty people Im prepared to be convinced on that  This whole thread is about a white woman stating a preference for not dating black men  Thats not only a deeply ingrained biological phenomenon but in terms of DV rates it appears to be less dangerous to date white people on average for white women  Your point about white serial killers is just idiotic  most people who commit violent crimes including shootings in the US black  Based on the white population in the US white men arent overrepresented as shooters or any other violent criminals from what I can tell from the FBI statistics  

Different groups of people have different average characteristics so it does make sense to pay attention to race in the context of DV if it appears to be a relevant factor  For example aboriginal women in Australia are 37 times more likely than average to be hospitalised due to domestic violence  Rates broken down by the perpetrators profession are also going to vary why not by race",1,1050

"However it is also possible that the nonsignificant findings among interracial couples and monoracial black couples were due to smaller sample size Therefore caution is needed when interpreting the findings

Listen context is very important 

Research is very subjective these days and there are more than a few things to take into consideration when interpreting data in specific areas like this

gtBut I guess white women trying to avoid DV is racist now

Everyone needs to avoid domestic violence black white or green 
Reasonable people know very well that domestic violence shouldnt be a race thing its rather stupid to make it so

Theres an alarming rate of domestic violence issues in the police force and an alarming rate of sexual assault and rape in the military We all know the  of cops and military men with white as their ethnicity is way up there

Do people now refuse to date or marry white police officers or military men because of this 

As an aside There are numerous scholarly articles that have reports on Family annihilatorsperpetrators of familicide rapists stalkers and serial killers being white males by a very high significant percentage in comparison to men of other ethnicities with research to back it up BUT white womenas well as other ethnicities still date and marry white men

By your logic in the sentence I quoted could it now be said that white men should be completely avoided

So its just a coincidence that every majorityblack area in America has higher rates of crime and black people make up 52 of all violent crime  Come on youre being delusional now  Were talking about average group differences and the stats are what they are  If you want to call stereotyping based on observable reality racist youre welcome to but it kinda guts the word dont you think

"This is a mouthful for just saying Im racist

Nobody on this thread ever said ingroup preference is racist and you know it lol

"I never said that  The substance of her belief is most likely rooted in racism but her preference to date only white men isnt racist when considered in a vacuum

Im able to speak about my own experiences  I grew up in a town that used to be a thriving steel town  There was a vast manufacturing infrastructure which created a ton of jobs and a great community

That town is now a war zone  The demographics completely swapped  the influx of black families occurred and a coincidental rise in crime started  The trend continued until the workers abandoned the area because it was no longer safe  Losing their workers with no one trying to fill those roles the businesses shut down  The mass exodus occurred leaving the town in its current makeup  approximately 97 black

In its current makeup the town has a higher violent crime per capita than Honduras which is the most dangerous country in the world  I cant even show people where I grew up because its unsafe to be white there  I harbored a ton of anger towards what happened to my home

BUTI also recognize that those folks are a small subset of black people  They dont represent all of them I meet or see  So it would be easy for me to call back on my experiences and say I understand her feelings  But I also am adult enough to know that where I came from only represents 20k people  Theres definitely more than 20k shitty white people too

I feel like her words were intended to be racist  Soyeah",1,1453

"Oh good now that youve declared its not an opinion it has magically transsubstantiated into a fact  If her preference is acceptable then so is others adopting or practising it  which happens to intrinsically be the case anyway

You absolutely get it and rest assured that guy supporting the racist gets it too

"Many secular Jews like David Reich also marry other Jews its not just a religious thing  The religion is a layer over the ethnic identity to ensure the race remains a distinct entity

"There is nothing wrong with having a preference But using phrases like Mud Shark The Darks and White Women do not belong with Black Dudes indicates more than just a preference but a belief that they are superior and that black people are inferior which is pretty much the definition of racism 

I a white male have a preference towards black females but I wouldnt start a conversation with something along the lines of Are you an ebony queen or white trash Because I only want the darkest of darkies therefore kinda being racist to both sides there Just asking about race does not make you a racist the following statements afterwards are what show she is",1,655
"Exactly I think its not if you dont like astrology youre a misogynist but its about looking at why you think its stupid when the chances are people havent actually looked into it Its been studied for generations and its really complicated whether you believe it or not you cant say its stupid because by definition its just not

"Also to add to all this for the sake of arguments she also immediately asks white or black Not just are you white And then responds in absolute relief at the answer of the former 

Idk how this can be interpreted as anything BUT I dont like black people and white people shouldnt be with them but other races might be fine but Im specifically against blacks 

The only indicator of her preference away from other races other than black people would be her use of the term the darks which literally just is so damn racist and again only focuses on color rather than ethnicity or nationality Ive had my fair share of bad experiences with other races to where Ive developed preferences but would never be so blatantly racist as to refer to people by a general derogatory descriptor like that People are still people and should be treated as equals regardless unless the individual themselves proves to be a shit human being 

Defending this woman in this interaction is basically racism bleeding through poor arguments

I normally just sit back and pull a MJ popcorn meme with this type of shit but I really wanted the people defending her statements to know how pretty damn racist and stupid they sound",1,1200
But if you accept her personal preference and you note that most people date within their own race then her statement is just a generalisation based on observable reality  Mud shark seems more derogatory to other white girls than it does to black men  Rates of domestic violence are also higher amongst mixedrace couple so you could take that into account when shes being prescriptive like that,1,394

"Just keep one shirtless photo 3 is just too much and gives off a douchey vibe I like the one on the beach its very sexy and since youre in the water shirtless is befitting the scene Youre good looking but you need a bio I dunno what all of that says obviously but if you had anything funny or charming in it youd be golden Anything about your dreams aspirations or goals What you like in a woman and what you like to do for quality time For bios you want to keep it simple and make it easy for a woman to picture herself with you

Example
Im looking for a smart intuitive witty insert adjective here woman who loves to laugh eat all the food seek knowledge be outdoors insert activity or thing you would love to do together

Im a man who wants to take you to a fancy restaurant learn a new skill together go on a picnic go wine tasting enter activity you enjoy sharing with good company Ive been told Im a pretty good listener cheerleader chef dishwasher massager enter something that makes you a good friend or boyfriend 

I love cuddles and have a nice chest for someone special to lay her head down on after a long day of life End on something sweet or quirky Only say something like this if its true

"Thats exactly my point my guy She said no because x The thing is it doesnt matter if her reason is x y or z A no is a no Getting upset over it because of her reason invites the argument that some reasons for saying no are invalid

If your reason for saying no is invalid then your no also is invalid This is just a roundabout way of pressuring people into doing whatwho they dont want to do 

Ive seen this same thing with the Trans community when a man only wants to date women who were born women you can see people arguing that there is no difference between a Trans woman and one who was born that way

Congratulations Youve got it all,1,32
Welcome to Reddit lol,1,21
Also is there any other thing that I can do for a better profile,1,64
So youre just annoyed by how she expressed herself  The sentiment is unobjectionable  We have an evolved preference for mates of our own ethnicity  Saying something like white women dont belong with black men is crude but merely projects her preference to other white women which is generally true  You could also find out that interracial relationships have higher rates of domestic violence and that might give some more weight to her statement  Either way ingroup preference and therefore outgroup nonpreference isnt racism  If you think it is everyone is racist which makes the term meaningless which it pretty much is at this point anyway,1,643

I think most people would agree that its not racist if youre not sexually attracted to specific features 

I mean she could have worded it better but whatever She thinks that way",1,230
"If u dont why do u want to attract women who are into it I totally hate all that bullshit and a man having anything astrology related in their bio including just mentioning their sign is an instant left swipe So of course you end up feeling all females love astrology when u yourself repel the ones who dont 

This is very common mistake from people in dating profiles  you are trying to please some stereotype which u dont even like ending only to repel the ones whod actually share your values

ps i also swipe left the ones mentioning their height If you want chicks who feel height is important Im not your chick",1,616
"What is this magical place you refer to

Edit Ive never heard of any person who tries to specifically get with someone whos in an open relationship so I doubt that exists",1,170
"Practice it more often Youre going to make many mistakes but each is a lesson and the more you do it the better you get Like Macklemore said The greats werent great because at birth they could paint the greats were great because theyd paint a lot

People arent born good at conversation  we all just practice it at our own pace Sure some get good at it really early because they wouldnt shut up as a kid and their parents were also good conversationalists so it seems like they are just born that way but really they just started early So if you want to improve yourself do it theres no real trick to instant success just practice",1,630

Show your real self Whatever that is We certainly have no idea based on this profile",1,216
"Take off the vape pic that send all the wrong signals to the degree that I dont believe your shit bio

Looking for something real is a bio for girls who are hot enough that you wonder why they are on Tinder  For a dude especially a dude in a patriarchal region you need to sell yourself in more detail and with some actual humility  Not saying you need to put yourself down just be honest about who you really are and what you are looking for in some detail",1,457

No need to put your Instagram are you looking for free follow like chicks 
Ring pic not good coz foreshadow a married dude
Kid in the background foreshadow you have a kid 
Mode than one picture with the same outfit Not good 
Put a short bio like meet new people or something simple The less info you give them directly in bio the better it is

"Ive made it quite clear in previous comments that i think youre making some pretty huge assumptions to get to that point which is part of what made your response to her ridiculously condescending Youre really oblivious to how you come off and youre STILL clinging on to your assessment based off of 2 visible lines coming off at the end of 3 dates and who knows how many texts back and forth but no theres no other other see it and youre trying to tell a woman how women feel

Thats why it merited the sarcasm You cant see how ridiculous you are being",1,551
Make the picture with the lemurs on you your 1st pic,1,52
maybe add a bit more to your bio height likes dealbreakers youre attractive so id match you if you were over 511 im tall,1,120
Be honest Option 1 was offering to make Tater Tots with her,1,59
I can see that ring,1,19
i feel you about people writing off a lot of thing women like as dumb or making fun of women for liking it but idk with astrology i kinda get it i think its literally just bc people became super fucking annoying about it kinda like vegans,1,238
You monster ,1,12
Id swipe left on the bio alone  gotta change that Be more humorous and talk about your interests Dont want to bring your baggage in from the jump,1,145
"Hes not a creep but she isnt wrong either However him thinking since she approached him earlier and now she cant back off like this is apparently wrong

I hadnt had success with tinder but I didnt post on Reddit why I wasnt successful Its dating Its complicated,1,108
This dude sounds like borat,1,27
You look superficial,1,20
Okay Noted,1,10
"The problem is that your comparison criteria is too broad At this level you could also say that marriage is like employment because money flows from one party to the other and both have responsibilities So the comparison becomes meaningless

A lifetime romantic relationship requires a deeper level of compatibility and commitment than a friendship therefore it follows that fewer people on earth will be compatible with you for marriage than for friendship From this it follows that you will need to test more people for marriage than for friendship

Therefore we can conclude that its better to pursue romance with strangers sometimes and a bad idea to try to form friendship with every person before trying romance Statistically you just dont have that kind of time",1,768
Great first pic last selfie pic is a very unflattering angle imo,1,64
Red does stand out  its a great pic you should do well with it,1,62

"Hey Woman here no one wants to go on a first date to read psychology it just gives me the vibe that you are gonna psychoanalyze me the whole time Just say I like to go to out of the way Cafés and discover new places

Also soft spot for dogs Just say you love dogs

Otherwise your profile is good Amd youre good looking

I hope you find someone",1,343
Feel like theres too little close ups You can hardly see your face in the first couple pics Theyre either covered up face to the side or too zoomed out,1,151
I think the only concern with the yoga pic would be that it isnt obvious that you are doing yoga it just looks like youre doing a handstand with your shirt off So in my opinion I would maybe replace it with a pic where it is obvious you are doing yoga,1,251
Id make 4th pic your main,1,25
My bad ,1,7
"A whole lotta bullshit Sounds pretty political tbh 

1They want to make sure nobody shows up when gay couples are looking to start families

2They want to make sure that if somebody does show up gay couples go through physicians charging 3000 per attemptIt generally takes multiple attempts according to the article

Weird that the article has 0 mentions of the womans side of things Just him vs government",1,406
Thanks Gotta learn how to do that first but point taken ,1,56
Maybe the other person took it as a warning to avoid landmines on the foowung day We dont know which part of the world they live in it could be a major issue over there,1,168
Only thing I would say would be to upload a picture of you smiling maybe Idk,1,76
"Thanks You know its so weird on hinge that photo gets the most likes And I literally just read a book on digital minimalism that had this random example of how random things we dont think about can have a huge impact on our choices

The example was that apparently people who wear red in their dating profile pictures get by far more attention than they would otherwise

I thought it was BS but it did cite a reference Now I cant get that shit out of my head",1,458

 The vaping picture isnt adding anything This is your dating profile and you are trying to show your best side and vaping is not a great look The one picture with your friends could be cute if yall were doing something This brings me around to the next point around these pics they dont really show what hobbies or interests you have Pictures that arent visually strong can still be good is they are showing off other parts of your personality 

Speaking of personality the bio is pretty bad It doesnt say anything about you and it seems like you arent into astrology so its strange that the Leo thing is in there at all",1,941

Most Women look for a guy thats obtained status and wealth For most men this doesnt begin to happen until early 30s at best At your age they mostly wanna ride the cock carousel while hoping a winner at life picks them Most winners know how to properly vet a slut and wont choose them regardless so the jokes on them But I wouldnt really spend time at any point in my life looking for a female The right one will come looking for you Until then just focus on being a better guyparticipant to society Lift weights,1,511

I wasnt into astrology before But an year ago I found a good source of astrologywhich is free and it matched with 23 very bad and very good things that happened in my life with the kundali predictions They didnt say what happened to me but just that I had a really bad or a really good time between this and this time period I didnt want to believe it but I hadnt told anyone about 2 of those things so its pretty stupid to assume they knew from before

In that case I would maybe try something like tell me something about my sign or looking for someone who can tell me if our signs are compatible  its something easy to make conversation off in your profile and something you have a basic even if limited knowledge of from your friends talking about it As a girl I always try to have conversation starters in my profile and I will more likely chat first on a guys profile if he has something that I can easily make a comment on I also think astrology is kind of a low stakes thing to open up a convo I could say a thing or two about my sign and a few other signs but I really dont take it that seriously or believe in it at all,1,675

"Remove the vape pic

Looking for something really is a vague and low effort statement and its also too generic Everyone puts it

Describe yourself What do you value What is an absolute no for you

What kinds of books do you like to read Or better yet what are you reading right now Whats important to you What are you passionate about How would you describe your personality 

Also do you have pics from different locations 

Finally look at it and ask yourself would I be intrigued by this person Or ie this profile boring and generic

And whatever you do avoid any kind of negativity It is such a turn off

And maybe leave the IG profile out if it as well",1,657

For stuff like this it just comes off as unwilling to compromise or try something imo Just swipe left to that thing,1,115
The most overused bio This along with Aspiring MILF,1,51
"Hey I was also nervous about messaging guys when I first got on tinder My advice would be to have fun with it if you have anxiety 

To be honest I started out just looking at funny tinder convos on google images I didnt really meet with guys but looked at tinder more as an opportunity to practice my social skills The more you do so the more comfortable youll become The nice thing about using tinder to help with anxiety is that you can set your distance way out and not have to worry about seeing that person around Also a lot of matches will ghost or just stop talking and thats honestly normal so dont let it get you down 

My best conversations have been when I had no filter which took a while to develop Ive had gif battles with guys talked about some weird shit and just generally used it as entertainment lmao So my advice as follows 

1 look up funny bios on google and here Typically I dont like giving out a lot of info about my interests right upfront because I like to leave that for the conversation I like to have a funny bio such as Looking for a date to compete for drunkest person over wedding season and to avoid uncomfortable questions from that one aunt who asks far too many Must be able to schmooze the older crowd and have mad dance moves Send me your resumé in MLA format I wasnt actually looking for a date but it just left for an interesting opener for guys to do something with and I had guys do everything from sending a detailed resumé to saying MLA is their bane of existence ask when is the wedding Etc It all left for interesting points of conversation 

2 Worry less about what to say If all that comes to mind is Hey then thats okay Start with that You can open a conversation literally any way you want even with a gif if you want to give it a try The worst someone will do is unmatch and really it could be for any reason like finding someone else too Alternatively you could look at their bio see someone has that they like hiking from their pictures and open with something like If you could go on any hike in the world what would you choose and why Or Where was that hiking picture taken It looks amazing 

3 Conversations in tinder with most usually tend to die at some point so learning how to hook from the last sentence can be a good tool to revive a dying convo if by your direction of conversation and not lack of interest I always look for ways to continue open questions and some can be loosely related For example a guy may say something like I like coffee which is close ended there are different options to open that conversation back up 1 I also like coffee Cant do without the magic black morning potion  Are you not a morning person too gt First sentence hooked his comment second related to the question with a little humourgt third was an open question bringing up another topic 2 Good to know So our first date should be coffee How about food My favourite is X How about you I call this explorative because its making for an image date but we are not actually planning a date just getting to know each others interests And if wanted you can actually make it into a date too 


Im of the opinion that the absolute best way to tinder is to be yourself Sure you can try to adapt yourself to someone elses humour etc but chances are that dating that person wont work out anyway I like to have long deep conversations and sometimes I can be a little random joke around and maybe even weird If someone doesnt vibe with that its cool I would like to know that earlier on as it saves time",1,3539
Definitely better,1,17
Just cause dudes swipe right on everyone doesnt mean they start conversations with all of them I mean do you think swiping right on all is really a high effort strategy on their part You are also allowed to message first Hi hello hey hola could go old school with a sup People are just people Dating app conversation starters are relatively low risk You just pull out all the stops on starters when you want reddit karma ,1,421

Get more variety on your pics all but like 2 look like they are from the same dayouting Put a few more things in your bio and Id get rid of looking for something real that may be the truth but it sounds condescending Could put something like ready to go the distance as a way of saying youre looking for a committed relationship My bio is extremely sexually aggressive because thats what Im trying to get but if youre trying to date put down some hobbies that are dates like hikingbeach daysfavorite foods,1,505
Typical Tender,1,14
Honestly and take this with a grain of salt because I may be a minority but the single line saying looking for something real would absolutely turn me away And not because Im not but simply because it kind of adds pressure to just even casually trying to get to know you Its like when I see someone write looking for my wife like I get it we ultimately all are because duh were on a dating app but it definitely puts a lot of pressure before even getting to talk to you first,1,475
"Youre actually hopeless You ask for feedback and then shit on everybody who even suggests anything other than to keep up all your cute little winkys and kissies 

Maybe Ive overanalyzed and overpreached some alphaesque strategies but Im married and had a modestly successful dating history learning some hard lessons along the way and youre here posting on rTinder about another flame you smothered out with your impeccable dating strategy

Good luck finding your unicorn Ill make sure to follow you to see the next few episodes of the Friend Zone",1,547

"This is extreme harsh criticism coming from F22 in college with my initial thoughts and reactions I realize that this may seem harsh but I figure that since youre basically asking for a review here it is

1 Take out the vape picture 
2 space out second and third pic for some reason it bothers me when pictures obviously taken during the same timephoto shoot are back to back Makes me think they dont have any other good pictures of themselves period
3 not sure the type of girl you are going for but the bio is so generic Meh if you want a hookup but absolutely atrocious if youre looking for something long term I want to get to know you not some generic copy paste shit I see all the other time A short list of how you define yourself artist reader doctor musician foodie etc then some short list of hobbies that youre looking for Lets me know your interests and whether I see if mine align with something like that Personally for me its a deal breaker if I cannot tell from a guys bio if hes nerdy enough Kudos on it not being blank though 
4 Take out the Insta Im so tired of seeing that in guys profiles its an instant left from me 
5 you need a more flattering photo of you with your dog the angle isnt attractive
6 you need a better first photo Yes its a good one Yes its scenic and can be a convo starter but isnt one you want to start with on Tinder You need one that makes you seem more sharp sexy or mature Basically formal wear I find that those that lead with something like that grab my attention more 
7 the photo with your friends is okay I guess You want photos that only display how attractive you are You just look meh in it not showstopping which is what you need if you want more rights",1,1708

"Eh

Probably your approach

Your pictures look fine Maybe you come off as boring in them Im not sure though You got kind of the basics A decent main photo Youre doing something in others The vaping one sure can alienate people so you could potentially drop that one

If you want some nit picking drop the looking for some real and put something a little more half hearted in there

It can be something stupid just to get someone to smirk or just lay out the goods like what youre into for a pretty basic profile

Dont want to put too much effort and dont waste too much time getting to know someone in messaging Aim to get the date in a week when interest is most high You can share and learn about them to your hearts content in person on that date then

A good rule for me was if they were responsive and didnt come off as boring Id probably ask them out within a few messages

Oh and I started with hi I gave up on the long clever ice breakers Invest the effort on the girls that are actually willing to meet you in person Thats when you can pull all the moves and say all the clever dumb shit

Number one rule in it all Just have fun Do it for yourself That is how you find something real",1,1192

Damn youre smooth,1,17
3 of your photos look like they were taking on the same day the first 2 and your last one with your mates As Ive been told before having different photos in different outfits could possibly help And yeah remove your Instagram women may sneak a look at your profile to confirm youre a real person but dont take that much of initiative to slide into a guys DMs,1,358

Because you didnt get any matches,1,33
Good bio good pics good luck,1,28

"Nah this is great You want sexy sexy with a match huh 

If you looking for a nice girl who doesnt send nudes on the first chat then tone it down Otherwise you might be scaring them away 

Your profile translates Im a sexy smart guy who wants poon Im too goodlooking to be single so something may be off Ask me about my wod and Ill share my preferred protein powder By the way I like computers",1,392
Useless for me as I never get any matches,1,41
"Hi Im a woman but that by no means implies I know what all other girls want I did find my bf of about 2 years ish on Tinder so I do know a bit about that at least Personally though if you are looking for pointers

1 Tell me about yourself Even though youre handsome I would swipe left because your bio doesnt actually say anything

2 You have a couple pics by the beach Thats cool But at least dont put them next to each other and if you get rid of one probably the side profile would be the one Id ditch It isnt anyones most flattering angle and it isnt because youre ugly its just angles and art tbh

3 I love the umbrella picture but it gives a nerdysilly vibe which will attract the same so keep that in mind

Youre pretty handsome and have a wonderful smile I really think if you put more of a bio youll get some matches Good luck man",1,839
Girls need to feel safe and have a connection before they will meet If you push them to meet right away you will scare a lot of them off or make them think you are just looking for sex,1,184
Correct you have to pay to know they read your message on Tinder,1,64

This happened to me a couple months ago and hes become a great friend I appreciated the honesty as I think its so much better than thinking WTF after getting ghosted And I got a wonderful friendship out of it,1,208

If he wants to get laid then likely yes Thats why you had the whole 1111 craze a while ago,1,90
You are nibba,1,13
Yep,1,3
See this is the root of the problem You demand evidence and proof but at the same time cannot offer any counter evidence or proof to the contrary The concept shouldnt be dismissed altogether simply because the why cannot yet be explained and it takes some consideration to see how it works for yourself Its a subjective experience,1,330
"Go party with your female friends and take pictures with them Post one of those Have a silly party where you wear funky costumes maybe a rave take pics with your girlies Post those Now you seem interesting Have a picture taken of you while sitting at a table outdoors the camera person must take the pic while they are sitting across from you Smile with a drink you like doing cheers

So when a woman sees these she thinks mh he likes doing fun things he has woman around him thats safe okay and he has a great smile this could be me across from him Boom goodluck also better in person woman get 1000s of matches and pick from the top",1,634
Congrats,1,8
At me next time bro,1,19
Female here I would take off the last two pictures vape and umbrella one and write more in your bio  Any chance your narrowed your search too much of what you are looking for You absolutely should put what you are honestly looking for but one of my close guy friends doesnt get matches and I really think its because he says he is only looking for women WAY younger than him,1,374

I see several mistakes First mistake is you arent  62 with a shredded 6 pack Second mistake is you are on tinder without having accomplished step one Third mistake is not being an American in a third world country,1,213

Dont you have stock options and a car lease by now Perhaps advertise any maturity you may possess It will balance out your cool photos 

You are handsome man with interests Beef the bio",1,297
"Make a fake girl profile and see the option they have Now take a look at your profile Its one thing to be optimistic but sometimes you have to be real with yourself You are not handsome enough to be on Tinder or any online dating sites The longer you expect the more its going to drag your self confidence 

Just accept the loss and move on to real world dating You will seem like a pretty good match when you are not being compared to 50 other men in the span of 8 mins",1,470
Funnily enough that that doesnt get removed Just screwing around I tried to upload a shirtless selfie from when I was lifting a ton Wouldnt upload for the life of me,1,165
As you stated in your post a lot of guys swipe right on everyone I dont but I know I am one of the few As far as if you brought it on yourself is up for debate From what I read you are currently suffering from some confidence issues we all do from time to time But ultimately you have to love yourself before you can love another The anxiety is not helping either I suffer from anxiety and depression so I understand what you are going through,1,443

Most people who like astrology are women or nonbinary people Thats why people are so committed to not understanding it and find it stupid Anything women like in great numbers people are gonna hate pumpkin spice lattes cats make up Sports is completely made up and I find it stupid and pointless but its a man thing so no one really cares,1,337
No problem Have a wonderful day and remember someone is gonna find you beautiful irresistible and will make you as happy as can be,1,130

I brought this to myself didnt I I tried Bumble but there i barely hey matches I tried other apps and no luck its Tinder I get the most matches trust me if that wasnt the case Id delete the app forever,1,201
Hey girl we are actually of the same age Usually I dont start conversations on dating sites as well just because Im not really sure if the guy and I would have the same interests and I dont want the conversation to just be his and hellos For starters maybe you can say something about their bio or something you see on their pictures on their dating profile Something that piqued your interest then go from there Some people dont reply from just simple hi or hello so say something interesting First impression counts Go get them girl,1,534
I think you need some photos that arent selfies Some in a group setting and some showing a hobby or a bit of personality maybe I think your 3rd pic is nice and you can have one or two selfies but just spice it up a bit I like the bio tho funny is always a good way to go,1,270
First pic might get a lot of automatic left swipes plus the bio could hurt your odds as well You seem fit maybe try a shirtless pic of you at a beach,1,149

Interesting fact buffalocow milk taste much better than human milk Its actually dull amp tasteless I read this somewhere,1,120
Comment on something specific in one of their photos amp or Bio It will show your not a bot or fake account Girls have to deal with guys who swipe right on everything amp guys deal with 50 fake accounts it will show your yr real amp then you can have a actually real conversation  hope that helps,1,296
oh thank you so much I know I should go for it but I get in my own way It honestly started in college when I got into acting and was getting rejected left and right fucked me up Left the industry but started doing some modeling but it is also a toxic place not sure why I like things that fuck me up mentally   maybe I mediate before I go online to calm my nerves Thank you for the advice ,1,389

Be original What does looking for something real even mean It comes off as negative as if so far youve been tricked Everyone says it

What do you really want to find 

The smiling photo in the beginning and the photo with the dog are very cute The one looking at the ocean looks like its a modeling photograph doesnt say anything about who you are Get rid of the vaping pic Smoking guns not smiling at the camera sunglasses and hats are a turn off to most women same with the tough gangsta looks guys dont seem to know what woman like

i would say just go for it especially in tinder there is always a sea of guysdont overthink it just say something if they dont say shit fuck em on to the next,1,158
Dont worry about anything If its meant to be its meant to be Im sure your beautiful in your own way If they dont talk within 2 days just unmatch because its not worth the energy your giving it Your more than welcome to start the conversation any way you like Be a goofball have fun and if they cant match your energy then its not meant to be,1,341
Honestly Im an adult male I consider myself pretty average Getting matches isnt a problem And often I dont message people I match with Sometimes I go back and see who I matched with and dont remember swiping on the person But Ill have some people kinda backed up The number goes up the more I have the app Then sometimes Ill go back and talk to people later I think peoples biggest mistake is they install tinder and think I need sex now Also if someone stops talking be thankful they arent wasting more of your time,1,516
Congrats to you both  Thats just awesome  Im sure youll enjoy your life together,1,80

23 yr old woman here and this is my honest opinion when a guy has their Snapchat or Instagram link right there it seems chauvinistic more like youre there for followers rather than a connection Second I personally never swipe on somebody with their horoscope I think its just silly it just tells me a time span of when you were born its not a personality trait And third of all the vape pic I smoke weed and I dont mind if people vape but I think I am one of millions who is just tired of seeing fruity scented vape clouds everywhere,1,533

I say that not to suggest doing those things will suddenly make you more dateable  I say it because doing those things and living a life based on enjoying the moment and doing things worth your time will let you see how much dating doesnt matter

"Hello fellow Bumblers So Ive F31 messed up Matched with this lovely guy M33 two weeks back and we had our first date a few days ago I think it went well and we have unconfirmed plans to meet up again 

So we havent messaged each other for a few days and this morning I receive a message from him saying So I see youve discovered my Instagram somehow Cue the cringe which is still radiating off me right now 

Ughhh So there I am balls deep in his Instagram history and Ive accidentally liked an old post of his My account is clearly me full name etc 

So how likely is this going to put him off me Im saddened to admit that Ive dated some pretty creative liars in the recent past discovered theyre married etc so once I know I like someone a little I do like to have a little snoop just to ensure they are who they are telling me they are 

Im just mortified right now",0,868

"I have had a Bumble membership free for approximately a year now and in that time I have gotten TWO yes two matches that actually came close to progressing to a date I say came close because in one instance the girl had used heavy Snapchat filters for her pictures on the app and I was no longer attracted to her when I saw real pictures so I canceled the date I didnt feel it would be fair to progress with it With the other match she ghosted me as soon as I asked her out in person

I see my average looking friends and my outofshape and unattractive friends getting matches and going on dates left and right This is with attractive women also Its not like theyre matching with only women who are in their league From the profile reviews Ive gotten my profile is great And Ive had many people both inside and outside of my family rave about my looks This wasnt just to be nice The subject of looks and dating never even came up but they went out of their way to tell me I should be a model So I just dont get it

Two matches in a year seems really bad and Im thinking theres something wrong here I had a membership from 2018 through 2019 as well and I had deadon zero matches messages or dates in that entire span despite spending considerable time on the app every day and making sure my profile stood out Ive happened to glance at my friends phone sometimes if were together and hell have easily 1520 conversations open at a time This is an average looking fellow with a bushy beard I DO NOT UNDERSTAND What am I doing wrong I should mention that I live alone in the suburbs in a neighborhood surrounded by families and elderly people Is this the actual problem

"A few months ago I joined bumble for the first time and matched with a guy that had some potential We exchanged a few messages even some voice notes and the conversation was actually interesting not just boring small talk Then boom he ghosts I ended up leaving bumble not long after because where I live theres just not much going on 

Now Im back on the app and he appeared again I was able to figure out from the blurred image on my beeline that he had swiped right on me so I decided what the heck why not Now my question is do I message again And if so then what do I say If this were a different app where the woman didnt have to message first I would definitely leave the ball in his court

I recently downloaded bumble and got 3 matches within a week

I met with one at a bar and another days later over video chat and I got ghosted by both within a day 

It always seems like everything is going well and smoothly but the ghost blindsides me so hard Its only happened twice but my heart really sinks everytime this happens I keep believing its my fault that if I were just somehow better I wouldnt be ghosted like this so soon

Im sure people feel hurt when theyve been ghosted but do you guys also feel like your chest hurts and you just beat yourself up about it a lot Everyone says move on but how long has it actually taken you to move on

Sorry this is long and personal I just want to understand how other people have experienced this exactly",0,771

I have noticed on profiles there are lists of demands instead of spending the space for talking about who you are and what you bring to the table  This always confuses me as I think about watching a commercial for a Big Mac at McDonalds  They dont say you must pay 4 you must come in during these hours and you must wear shoes and a shirt pants optional I suppose  The commercial is more like come on in for this delicious burger with its special sauce lettuce tomato pickle on a sesame seed bun  So what are people considering they will attract with a list of demands instead of the more soft theme of self description and virtues you consider you bring to the situation,0,671

Honestly at this advanced age Im blown away how hard it is to find someone seeking a relationship I live outside of Boston so there are lots of people but Im constantly running out of people to swipe on 

Are there men here actually seeking relationships Why does the r word make people run for the hills Why do men think Im going to show up for coffee in a bridal gown Any women experience the same thing

Does anyone here know people who actually met on bumble and are married today I joined bumble last week and my experience has been less than favorable 

Guys will match with me and when I message first with something from their profile like hey what is your fav song by Adele or how often do you go for a run a few hrs later theyll unmatch 

Im just 23 and should be meeting people outside but I work full time in higher Ed and Im very shy so putting myself out there is really hard Plus dating apps makes it easier to meet people you possibly wont come across irl 

Also you can cast a wide net distance wise I moved to a small town for work64k people and its mostly young families here 

My profile is modest wellcrafted and I make it clear what Im looking for serious LTR 
Also not trying to toot my own horn but Im pretty fit and caring so I dont know what Im doing wrong

I was at first a bit shocked how low my incoming was but the thing is as I am using Incognito mode my profile only gets shown to the people I swipe right on ie the top 15 of profiles so Im telling myself it would be higher otherwise Obviously there were at one point 10 matches not 5 and of those 10 I messaged I think 8 and all but 1 replied so at least I had a good response rate as I have heard here some women saying half or less of their matches respond,0,458
Most apps protect against felons Bumble does not I was sexually assaulted and given an incurable std by someone using a fake first name I only discovered their real name at the last minute After putting it into google they came up as having felony domestic violence charges I tried to contact bumble support to let them know about this person a week ago and I havent had anything come back Not even an acknowledgement This person still uses the app and is a danger Its unbelievable Bumble does not let you know felons are welcome on this app and you may be matched with one Bumble does not listen when you report a profile or send written reports and support emails You ARE in danger,0,683

But one guy had in his profile that he was 44 and he didnt know why Bumble said he was 42 since he had it connected to Facebook So I come here asking

"People often ignore me on tinder because of my looks So I built an app that focus on your personalities

You may be an ordinary looking guy who is kind funny hardworking active and passionate for life yet people dismiss all of it without knowing the full picture In this app you can tag yourself with placesscenarios that would boost your profile The scenarios appears as the background of your profile picture so when people see your profile picture they automatically sees the scenario

At the same time you can also search for people who are interested in these scenarios All these scenarios give you common language to start highlight the angles you really shine and help separate yourself from the crowd

One guy I was seeing after two months  told me his family wouldnt  accept me because  of not being educated enough and Im sure me being black  had something to do with it

I work in healthcare  I provide care for the elderly   giving medication  and etc 

Another guy I met   went with the whole process and never mentioned  to his family   lied that he would but never did ghosted me and came back with a fake apology  to see if I still  had feelings  then was finally  honest that he didnt want  a relationship  with me  so hed  have strung  me along but his conscious told him it was wrong  so he ghosted 

I notice the men  mostly fetishized me   will date me knowing it wont ever go anywhere  either due to family or just not that  interested or just wouldnt date a black women long term

So now I want to let him know I dont think we should continue dating but I dont know when or how Is it now a couple hours after our date a few days from now Do I just ghost or I dont want to ghost too rude and apathetic since he really is a nice guy But I dont know when is appropriate and what is appropriate to say while being considerate of his feelings Help

"Im new to Bumble and have been puzzled why so far the majority of the men I match with dont reply to my initial message I mean why did they like my profile if theyre not interested 

One of the main reasons that Bumble appealed to me was that I could only send someone a message with the confidence that they were also interested in me unlike OkCupid where I also have a profile I also assumed perhaps naively that with Bumbles focus on women taking the lead that the men who sign up would be decent guys feminists even yes I was naive but it seems Bumble is too a forum for dishonesty and gameplaying

After some research I discovered that its apparently quite common for men to indiscriminately like every womans profile and only actually read her profile after theyve matched and then decide if theyre interested or not This means that when a match is made it could essentially be a false positive it doesnt necessarily mean anything So the thing that I liked most about Bumble is actually completely inconsequential 

I always put thought into my first message but now I wonder if I want to continue wasting my time and energy and due to chronic illness my energy is limited on men who let me believe theyre interested but may actually have no interest in me 

If a man isnt into me thats ok hes a stranger and its not going to hurt my feelings but I loathe gameplaying Obviously these men arent right for me anyway so Im not actually losing anything but couldnt they at the very least unmatch with me after reading my profile and deciding Im not for them Why remain matched with me and allow me to message them knowing that they wont respond Are they just after the ego boost  

After a positive start Im now feeling rather dejected Its really all just a game isnt it",0,1772

So far I have matched with about a dozen women and invariably the first message was Hey or hey you Now I know how hard it can be to come up with something to say but on any other app like this half of the profiles say if your just gonna say hey swipe left So tell me if Im crazy but that seems like a major double standard,0,322

We had a good dates mutually confessed chemistry laughed at how comfortable we were with each other There was an agreement to take things slow On our last date I was posed an odd question does the distance bother you We live two hours apart We are both busy adults and they work an atypical schedule four 12hr night shifts which can fall on weekends so the amount of time we would be mutually free was not going to be a lot anyways As a result the distance did not bother me Then they had to fly across country and be gone for a few weeks We had agreed on when we would see each other again ahead of time and I continued to reach out to let them know that I was thinking of them  With our date fast approaching less than a week I wanted to nail down specifics When I reached out I was informed that they enjoyed hanging out with me but the distance is too hard They offered to stay friends but they do not think they want this to develop into anything more

Well a couple of weeks later he pops up again as new I think why not and swipe right He matched with me again I thought it might be a catfish so I didnt send a message Because why wouldnt he just respond to my IG message Well he extended the match

I was so nervous during the second date as well and I ended up having to go to the bathroom to calm down and I threw up Ive never thrown up from anxiety before usually the opposite where I cant eat I didnt know what to do so I called my dad and he told me to chew some gum and get back out there lol I toughed it out for a couple minutes though before he could tell that I wasnt feeling good and he took me home cutting the date short So understanding even though I was too embarrassed to tell him at the time obviously lol

 Switched religion from from Atheist Agnostic Spiritual Other to Any
 Switched education from Undergraduate to Any

Beeline popped up to 18 sigh what So I started matching with them and confirmed they simply skipped these questions despite half of them being nonreligious and having a college degree

"I will be going home soon to visit my parents in my hometown for a month   I recently made a bumble profile and Im wondering if theres any point to having it active or checking it while Im home  Since Ill  only be there for a month I wont be able to build any kind of serious relationship or connection with anyone  Im not exactly typical hookup material and even if I matched with someone who was down I dont know if I personally would be comfortable with a random hookup  I wouldnt  even be able to invite anyone to my place either since Id be staying  with my folks

The problem is I know I will be unbearably bored and lonely during the month that Im home  None of my old friends live in my hometown anymore so it would  just be me and my parents  I love my parents but theyre kind of  boring and Im worried that Ill go insane after an entire month of  virtually no social contact this is coming off of nearly a year of  pandemic isolation too so Im going nuts

"So Ive had Bumble premium as a woman for a couple of months My profile lists some things to the effect of not really interested in travelling definite cat person can be judgemental sometimes Promise its not all bad vibes I do throw the good stuff in too Not the point though 

So I check out my beeline and a lot of profiles from dudes say things like my life goal is to travel the world if you dont like my dog it wont work looking for someone nonjudgemental Bonus points if they hit all three 

And Im like okay clearly you wouldnt make me happy and I wouldnt make you happy so what did you swipe right for Are you hoping one of us will change Because I sure as hell wont and I dont want you to either 

It just makes me feel like some men arent particularly good at filtering out women who arent compatible with them This would be fine as its easy for me to see that and swipe left for the both of us However Im pretty sure the same men saying they hardly ever get matches are also the same men swiping right on just about anyone and everyone 

Maybe the reason women match at a higher rate is because were better at thinking longer term and only make shots we think we have a good chance at scoring with Whereas men will generally take all the shots resulting in a higher miss rate which ends up depressing them 

I dont know man like Im pretty sure its not that cookiecutter simple Im just pointing out a trend Ive noticed in my own experience seeing all these likes I have from dudes who are perfectly great guys with expectations that are normal and are decently attractive but who havent taken the time to think about whether wed actually make each happier in the long run based off our personalities interests and goals",0,1728

"So as many of you have recognized I bitch and complain about dating apps Bumble specifically and why I get NO matches  Well I am sure the following issue has been covered here before but I wanted it straight from the horses mouth the reason I get no matches is A there are very very few available women in close proximity to me on Bumble  This is also an issue I have raised about IRL in my area too  B just because I am expanding my search radius out to beyond 50 miles to hit the next two largest cities near me if the women I am swiping right on have their distance set for less than that THEY WILL NOT SEE THAT I SWIPED RIGHT ON THEM  They have no clue  So unless I move closer to these more populated areas or the women choose to expand the radius on their distance filters Bumble is useless to me  

And I have confirmed through IRL and OLD that most women generally search out less than 50 miles   I wont get into the reasoning behind this because I will just get dinged for it   But I will say God forbid they meet someone an hour away I am sure there are plenty of people here that will respond back to tell me the real reason I dont get matches is that I am a horrible ugly person and distance has nothing to do with it  Whatever  So for all you people in rural areas that arent getting matches this is why",0,1316

I am starting completely from scratch in my new place of residence I gained almost 100 pounds from eating doing drugs playing video games and being a personal servant to someone who didnt deserve it for 6 years I was an athlete my whole life before this incident I was in wicked shape I slowly stopped playing sports after succumbing to multiple broken bones and surgeries I am extremely embarrassed to show my round face on bumble comparing myself to all the girls I see who are skinny and happy I have been on tinder and hinge for almost 2 years but I have only gotten 1 match in the entirety of that time I ditched hinge and tinder for bumble after seeing a post on the front page about a couple getting married after they found each other on bumble 

I have no idea how to date girls in person I have never done it before I dont even know how to get matches I have tried to be honest and genuine but it has gotten me nowhere I feel like I have to lose 100 pounds to have even the slimmest chance at finding someone on this app Im afraid to show my body Im afraid to show my face I angle the camera so my neck fat isnt noticeable in my photos but I just feel like I would be cat fishing some poor girl if we ever meet in person and she sees how overweight I am I did browse this sub some people post their profiles for critiquing but Im afraid of getting bullied for how bad I look in one way or another I need some help on where to start I truly have no idea Im 24 years old now with barely any experience in dating I havent been touched since I was 22 loneliness is driving me crazy Im looking for a companion who is willing to put in as much effort I put in I am willing to try anything to find a woman who is right for me Thank you for reading if you got this far I am open to any ideas",0,3251

She then accepted and immediately asked me how I treated my dog Strictlenient Does he get on the couchbed

I thought it to be an odd question considering most people would reply hey how are you formalities etc But I went a long with it I said I was lenient etc She replies and says her dog is trained and that having an untrained dog would be difficult to add kids to the mix I was like ok Then I tried to explain that I take my dog to other peoples houses all the time and he gets along fine with babies Hes a small dog Mind you I was taking her seriously as benefit of doubt

She then proceeds to say that she would never want untrained dogs around kids and that it was good that it worked for me but would not work for her and wished me the best So I said good luck

In her profile she claimed she wanted someone who doesnt think their opinion is the last word yada yada Instead she seemed to do just that to me

"The scenario is this Im 29 female confident and a healthy eater but a bookworm with almost exclusively academic interests who doesnt do sport I think that covers the superficial stuff that might be important My profile says Im looking for a relationship I get a lot of positive feedback on my profile and this translates into a lot of dates with people I have some reason to believe Im compatible with

Almost every single time they tell me a they would rather just be friends or in some way b they dont want to go on a second date

Regarding how I behave on dates Im polite If I make the mistake of rambling for a long time I apologise and make a point of listening and asking questions Tact and empathy are really important to me so even if Im not attracted to the person IRL I will try and make sure it isnt a total waste of timeboring for them I will try Regarding how I misbehave I sometimes mention sex or exes but do not go on about the latter 

Regarding similarity between my photos and how I look in real life almost all photos are from the last 6 months no filters and no makeup clothing style representative checked photos with friends to make sure they were representative My friends might have lied but I dont think thats where I went wrong

Even though it says what I do in my bio many guys seem to have overlooked that and I wonder if they thought I was socioeconomically inferior to them or unstable Im a grad student working on my 3rd degree but worked for several years before this degree again Im 29 and am financially independent Im not sure they understood all of this from student but they also didnt ask Maybe out of tact So the question then becomes Who would date a 29yearold student but then  if thats a dealbreaker its written on my profile so why go on a date in the first place

So I figured Id just ask what other than unambiguous assholery or drama someone bringing their mom on a date joking about murder etc prevented you from seeing a woman as gf material despite her profile Or what disparities you tended to notice between profiles and reality other than looks and style

Im just wondering if there is some incentive from Bumble to female subscribers to say hello to male subscribers  but then not reply beyond that  It just seems like this happens a lot to me I reply with something very innocuous short and polite but never a response after that Its almost like Bumble has a bot that kicks out short Hellos to men to keep them subscribing

Interesting convos back and forth playful banter conversation continues I inquire about what she likes for a potential date ideas around town transition to ask about her schedule set date and time get her number 

Then this is where I usually put myself in a weird spot Im not one who likes texting 247 before weve actually been on a date conversations progressively seem to get more dry the more we text I find and just feels kinda needy IMO

My question is what should my approach be to texting in between the initial conversation and meeting upbetween dates Obviously not drop off the face of the earth until the date but also not constantly texting everyday day right Naptime something about sleeping on a towel on the floor just hit different back then I know the guy usually should text first

Whats the happy medium If some guys and girls could share their approach to this that would be greatly appreciated thanks",0,1033
"Just moved to a new city and thought Id try bumble bff to find some female friends Im also female Not seeing many profiles that have my interests more introverted into video games nerdy things I swiped on the few who stated they were into this on their profile but havent met with one yet because they unmatch me when I start talking about games and nerdy stuff

To be fair my profile casts a wide net it states I like hiking drawing going out sometimes but also staying in watching tv and playing games Could that be a reason why Im getting people who arent really into the same stuff as me 

Im seeing a lot of profiles for girlgang coffee shops mimosas and tacos and laughing lots now People whose interests seem kind of basic if I really tone it down and message them that I like going out and exploring I get a much better response

In the smaller town I just came from I often held back my nerdy interests so I could hang with those who liked the basic stuff because I had limited friend choice Now that Im in a bigger city I felt like I could find at least 1 friend that would share my interests

Should I remake my profile with a better descriptionphotos Can anyone give some advice",0,1190

I made my account in February 2020 and had a great time with it  I actually met a girl in May 2020 and we were together until February 2021  After things ended with her I decided to give the app another go and redownloaded it in March this year 
However Ive been getting some sort of weird error loop every time I try to log in  I havent gotten any sort of notification that my account is lockeddisabled but no matter what device I try to use I get greeted with a looping login screen  I enter my phone number press signin then get taken right back to the login screen  No error or message saying my account has been locked or anything just a constant loop  I hadnt used the app since things got serious with her sometime last year so Im wondering if somehow my account was disabled for going inactive  However I havent received any sort of email or notification telling me this and it wont let me make a new account  just tries to sign me back in and takes me through the signim loop

"I know the algorithm is confidential but we can observe some trends as we use the app 

The biggest thing is that they put the most popular profiles first  I guess its to get people excited about the app Woah the people on here are amazing  But in terms of getting matches it does nobody any good  On my end Im reviewing a profile that has pretty much no chance of seeing me and matching with me she has 100 other matches shes focused on  On the flip side Im just adding to the 100 matches she has which does her no good  How many people can one focus on at once  

I would definitely propose showing some lesspopular accounts earlier in the queue because right now your average joe Bumble users are all looking at people who arent actually taking any more applications when they could be looking at each other and matching  I might go so far as to say that people with a certain number of matches should be removed from public view until they unmatch those they arent interested in  We can only focus on so many people before it becomes just ritualistic responding",0,1065

"So Ive met a girl from Bumble on Friday and we agreed to meet up for a 2nd date In an attempt to show good faith I gave her my number and activated the snooze mode without message I thought that all it does is to prevent new matches from happening and that it hides the current locationdistance for others in my profile I came to this conclusion because I couldnt see this information on said girls profile for a few days Maybe this was a bug 

Since I gave her my number and activated the snooze mode she didnt message me anymore I messaged her again a few hours ago as a last effort Nothing big just that its fine if she wants to keep on communicating through Bumble and that I hope the event from yesterday she is an event planner went fine Afterwards I decided to look up the snooze mode functionality panicked and disabled it right away

Honestly the FAQ on this on Bumble is pretty bad There is just not enough detail Even after looking through a few threads on this subreddit Im still quite unsure

 Why wasnt her locationdistance displayed for a week There was no message in the chat and all of a sudden I can see it again with no snooze activation message from her
 As far as I can tell there is some sort of message displayed in the chat window for all your matches when you have snooze mode activated Is this correct
 Since I deactivated Snooze mode today she got a message that I did so

Honestly Im a bit pissed Especially if all this confusion messed up what I had with the girl Of course I might just be a bit panicky Maybe she was just irritated because of the snooze message and decided not to message me anymore The match is still there after all but I wont know until evening because she is busy with another event Still  Bumble work on your documentation I really like the app but this ordeal gave me a bit of a heart attack",0,1844

The Queer Queue wants to hear from you Were you unfairly banned from Bumble We want to hear your stories along with past employees who have worked for dating apps like Bumble People who have used Bumble have come to us to share how their refusal for sex has caused other users to report them out of retaliation for not having sex These victims who are typically queer andor women are banned without explanation because they refused sex Retaliatory reporting is an unfortunate trend in dating apps and we want it to stop We hold companies accountable for their imperfect practices and we want to ensure your story is told,0,620

"As of this morning I started a social experimentsocial accountability exercise on bumble  
Im not where I want to be physically mentally or socially I was thinking about how I could gain some sort of an external stimulus to help me overcome my mental blocks to getting back in shape eating properly and working on myself mentally 

I thought of a experiment I could perform that would tell me how my progress was judged by other people Most people swipe based on the first picture they see so I decided to put a fresh picture of me as I am fat and unhappy Ill be uploading a progress picture every 2 weeks and I will see how the number of right swipes and messages changes from now until I decide to end the experiment  

Im seeing this as something that can keep me motivated to work out eat right and get right with myself  I have no expectations as of right now but if it provides some validation of progress and insight into the psychology of online dating Ill be happy  

I can think of a dozen ways that this experiment is flawed and that the data may be invalid but Ill just be collecting data as I go and I intend to give periodic updates here If the data is compelling and if the story is interesting I might make a detailed analysis 

Im open to suggestions on ways to improve the experiment or data points to collect  Im not a scientist and my sample size is n1 so take all findings as anecdotal  I know that Im probably skewing the data by stating in my profile that Im performing a social experiment but Im counting on the first picture being the driving factor for first impressions Im not sure how the matching system works or if leftright swiped matches get recycled so there is a chance that someone who has swiped left or right today may not see me as one of their matches in the future when I may have made progress

"This is way longer than I thought and not really looking for advice but definitely welcome any kind of response

Im a 31 yo male who has made just about every relationship  sexual mistake in the books  I have been with two girls over the past 12 years which ended with a divorce and 3 engagement rings  Much of my time was filled with tons of joy and tears  I have always thought that romance was stupid and even then I was someone that I would have done almost anything for when I dated them  I still probably would do a lot for my recent ex even though we dont communicate at all  

I broke off an engagement with my ex toward the beginning of 2020  Things ironically were going well at the time but some major issues surfaced that were talked about before  If you think about what the biggest thing that can break any partners kids thats what caused it  I was never shy about expressing my concern that I didnt want kids but was very honest that i am young 28 at the time and I might change my mind  I have meet guys that did so I figured it was possible  Push eventually came to shove and I dug deep into my soul whether or not I wanted to try to have kids and I felt sick to my stomach for 3 straight days  The next day I broke up with her and moved out ASAP  It was by far the hardest thing Ive ever done in my life because I definitely loved her

Fast forward 14 months after a LONG period of self reflection growing and lets face it being a man child  Also I have been on a major health journey I gave lost 20 lbs in a little over a few months but eat extremely healthly and feel insanely great  I have been on 5 dates since I have been using OLD and all of them have been fun but with none have really has a spark at all 

Now to the interesting part  I matched with someone who I originally might have swiped left if I knew more about her than her profile Im glad I didnt  She is a single mother  Spent 5 hours over two nights talking over the phone and have been actively regularly communicating with her  At this point she knows basically everything about me outside of very personal details that arent relevant to her anyway  She also confessed a ton of stuff  We both carry a lot of baggage but we both are essentially looking for the same exact thing  I kid you not that I literally cant stop thinking about her and Im meeting her in person for the first time soon  We know what each other look and sound like but there obviously can be surprises meeting in person anyway  I feel more emotions than I have ever experienced in my life right now and I have been through legit tragedies with both of my exes  Im mostly excited but there is a small part of me that wants to be all in knowing it will end in a broken heart

Then I accidentally deleted my accdont ask

Anyway matched with  her again but this time I used travel mode to visit her city a few more kms than minejust incase she filtered the distancebad idea in retrospect

She matched again with me and said hey Why are you visiting blank city I responded with  I thought I fuckdd up our first convo and thought you were cute again so just remembered your city 

She then replied with  what had we talked about lol I responded with  probably not much cause I dont remember either lol Hows your day going 

I know being a nurse is busy af  and then no response for a week and 4 days this time

Then I double texted and said she was stunning and no response Then 2 days I basically had a convo with myself for  her to unmatch me and then took it back saying she probably is busy during covid I know I fucked up

"I went on a date with this guy I matched with He said he has never been in a real relationship we are both 27 he instead has a lot of casual encounters but on our date he told me that he wants to get married and have kids one day but that he just hasnt met the right woman

We had a great first date and things got pretty physical at the end and we started to get touchy He wanted me to go back with him to his place but a dating boundary I have set for myself is no sex before exclusivity I explained this to him and he said that he can agree to that as long as there is good sexual chemistry

For our second date I agreed to sleepover his place I was supposed to go right after work but I forgot about a dinner commitment I had with a friend so I told him I would meet him later at 10pm He said that was cool I texted him before I was going to leave and saw that I had a missed call It turns out he was going out with his friends and wasnt going to be home for awhile

I got upset because I already had my overnight bag and everything with me and I felt like our plans were ruined He didnt see anything wrong and tried to reschedule our sleepover for the next day but I didnt want to do things on his time when it was convenient for him We talked on the phone and he ended up getting annoyed because I brought up how this isnt the first time we had a change in plan for our dates he forgot about our first date and had already made other plans when I texted him to see if we were still going so I brought that up and told him how I felt like he wasnt putting in as much effort into seeing me as I was into him

He got offended and called me selfish and selfcentered and said how he didnt have to leave his house for the first date but he did just to come and meet me and all of this other stuff He said that he always responds to me when I text him and that he is really trying his hardest Then he said that I was stressing him out and that he didnt want a relationship or exclusivity because its too much of a headache and he is too much of a hoe 

He said he really wanted to try it out with me but that it was too much and I was showing my true colors Now I feel like I ruined my chances with him before things even started and Im starting to even question if I had a right to feel as frustrated with him as I felt

So I noticed all the matches are males which I guess makes sense So I started matching with a few guys pretty quickly Every guy I messaged seems to want to hook up I started to figure out why dudes were putting straight in their bios now so I started swiping right on them only Then when I was messaging them about interesting topics they suddenly started asking me if I ever did anything with a dude or if I wanted to try

"Correct me if you think Im wrong It seems like bumble is now suffering from the same fate as other dating apps like tinder The hype has died down over the years creeps scare off a lot of people from the app all of the added micro transactions makes a ton of people not use it or just makes it way less likely to accumulate matches unless you pay

Ive had bumble since it first came out in 2014 as the alternative to tinder It use to be poppin and Ive met a lot of nice people over the years from it But now Every day I use my allotted free right swipes I make sure to use every last one Sometimes I even cave and purchase super swipes or whatever on certain people just increase my chances 

NOTHING works even when swiping like a mad man Even with spending money on it I probably get 1 match every 2 weeks and they usually dont message first and it disappears

Before you say well its probably your pictures bio or generally maybe Im just not attractive but thats not quite the case here lol Im no Spartan warrior or Chris Hemsworth and Im not cocky or arrogant but i am confident that Im a decent looking guy I use professional grade photos amp dont say any weird or off putting things in my bio

This exact setup a few years ago would had me getting more matches then I could juggle I could always be chatting with new people or planning dates Now I get little to none even with a ton of swiping I think its probably purposeful in an effort to drain more money from users who are desperate to get more matches Also one last thing Im a guy it probably works entirely different for girls Theres always more guys than girls on dating apps it seems Also guys are way more reckless when it comes to swiping right a lot will just mass swipe right on everyone lol

"So Ive 37M been on Bumble for a few years now and Ive definitely paid for a lot of SuperSwipes Heres my experience

Yes it does work sometimes but usually the girls who do match with me from the SuperSwipes either 1 dont ever start a conversation 2 Only say hi hey etc and never reply back to my responses 3 hold somewhat of a conversation but then disappear or unmatch with me Fine this dating scene sucks but heres what my rant is really about

Ive noticed that some of my friends are on Bumble and when I point out to them that hey I saw you on Bumble theyll sometimes respond oh I deleted that app and havent used it in a while I explain to them that their profile is still showing up in the app Probably because they havent actually deactivated their account

So now my theory is that there are a lot of unused profiles that Im swiping through and I wouldnt be surprised if Im spending my SuperSwipes on dead accounts floating around Bumbles database If this is the case I think its SuperUnfair

Conclusion  
We deserve a feature that confirms the end user has acknowledges receipt of the SuperSwipe regardless of if they decide to reject us Basically I want to know if my SuperSwipe is noticed And they should definitely do something about the unused profiles

Just Go Talk To Her

In the city named Toronto it goes like this

Guy   Hi my name is

Girl   Fxxk Off you have 3 seconds before I call cops on you

PROOF httpsmimgurcomgallerymxKH3fn

 Just Be Confident 

How can you be confident if girls tell you to fxxk off even before you finish the sentence  Hi my name is My confidence was shattered years ago

And if that was not cruel enough in Toronto women walk away as soon as they see a man approaching where they are

A few weeks ago I went to a bus stop because that is where my bus was coming

There was a young woman and when she saw me she walked away

I did not have any micro intention to talk to her  She looked in her early 20s  too many years of age gap  

A few minutes later the bus arrived and inside the bus there was the young woman who walked away

It hurt my feelings

I talked about it and other men told me

I notice similar patterns but that is what it is Toronto is a big city and women often suffer inappropriate advances and harrassment

Women told me

Better safe than sorry

We are not mind readers

We would rather hurt mens feelings than suffer any negative experiences

How can I gain a lover if women wont even let me say a word Or let me approach her

I didnt have any need to say a word to the young woman at the bus stop because if I had a question I can simply look it up on my phone and to be realistic phones sometimes provide more detailed upto date infomation

And my English pronunciation is problematic

I can read write understand English without any significant problems but my pronunciation is quite problematic",0,1600
"I posted a couple weeks ago when I was feeling sad and frustrated about people flaking I had 2 great dates last week and I do think this sub helped 

Some things I learnedchanged 

1 I took my IG handle out of my bio because people here said they tend to assume people who have SM handles arent as serious about meeting 

2 I changed a couple pics to show more of me smiling 

3 I raised the bar for a right swipe I stopped swiping right on people with loweffort profiles Used to be no effort was automatic left swipe low effort was a maybe 

4 I also lowered the bar for a right swipe in terms of looks Someone here suggested that if you feel a potential match may be compatible but youre kind of on the fence about physical attraction swipe right on them because there may be a spark in person Still not sure how that will play out but I do think my match quality has improved 

5 I paid more attention to conversation energy made sure to match energy with people I am genuinely interested in and unmatched people who werent putting effort and energy into the interaction 

6 I didnt suggest meeting I let my matches bring it up This one is hard for me because Im pretty forward but waiting for them to suggest meeting allows me to see who actually wants to meet me and who is just going along with my suggestion because they are bored

"God this post really hurts to make but I guess it could help with something Im going thru I initially posted this as a reply to another thread but maybe some people can relate and I found that reading other ghosted stories helped me a bit 

I recently met a very cute girl and we were talking on the phone about 2 days after matching on Bumble 3 days later we met for our first in person date and it went as well as Ive had first dates go in the past Conversations just flowed like crazy and we like many of the same topics of conversations In our second date we were in my apartment and things flowed very organically and we ended up having AMAZING sex Amazing not just in the sense that she was amazing in bed but I also had the sense that we really connected during it Im also very sure she really liked it too since she was quite vocal about it We both had an incredibly great time and we had our 3rd date three days later

On the 3rd date again we had INCREDIBLE sex but it wasnt just that We really connected thru our conversations we even had a meditation session together that day and made plans for the weekend She then got home that night we kept on texting but the next day nothing just nothing I sent her a message the day after 2 days after the 3rd date and she just replied with an emoji a funny one at least Its been 4 days since our 3rd date and nothing My last message was just a funny reply to her emoji I think I get the point she ghosted me My plan was the most common suggestion which is to ghost back But I saw a post that gives me an idea to reply back with something nonconfrontational to just let her know that she was pretty fucking cool and its fine if she doesnt wanna keep talking or going out

I guess I just wanted to share what Im going thru I honestly didnt think I could feel this way about someone just 2 weeks into knowing them and somehow it feels like I fell for her quite quickly which Im almost always very careful of

So Ive been exchanging messages with a guy for about 34 weeks now 

Somehow we still havent managed to meet up and the last time he asked there was a little misunderstanding I guess

Usually hes a very quick responder never took him longer than 12hours to reply to any message Now Im waiting for nearly a day now and still havent received an answer And hes clearly been online since I texted him 

So I have to assume that theres no interest anymore And weekends coming

"This isnt meant to be sexist but it is meant to call out a double standard and to genuinely ask is it ok to have a direct if somewhat off putting bio such as those common on some womens bios dont waste my time tall men only replace with no fat chicks for a male profile  absolutely no XYZ voters or the very useful one i do think men and women should be able to get away with  Hey or Hi or How are you responses get ignored or un matched or something to weed out the Insta and Snap attention whs male and female

I mean if woman can do so and not be off putting  why cant men

Id like to try a bio that states hey or hi intros  goodbye not following anyone on anything not messaging first on an app for women to message first  or something along those lines

Im sure it would come off negative or as bitter But isnt being truthful about the annoyances the spam and the idiots on Bumble  Ive seen womens profiles with bios similar do you think their match rate gets affected

Would be an interesting study to compare the effects of such a negative bio on male yes matching results vs a similar female bio matching result",0,1119
"Matched with a guy a month a few weeks ago messaged him but he didnt reply within 24 hours so it expired A few days later he appeared in my beeline so I matched him again this time he replied within 2 hours saying he was bad at checking the app how was my weekend etc So I replied a few hours later Now its been like 5 days and nothing

We have a few mutual friends on facebook and in their photos I saw he had been out of town at an event with them on our 1st match so I kind of gave him the benefit of the doubt on not responding that time But now Why even bother matching and replying if youre not interested

Should I just be patient I figure Ive already given him 2 chances I dont fancy reaching out again Part of me wonders if he just didnt want the match to expire this time so he could keep me as an option down the line he hasnt unmatched me yet

"Im so confused and pretty upset right now Finally met someone and hit it off held off on sleeping together after date 3 He left my place the next morning and I checked to find hes a Deleted account on Bumble and weve gone from texting everyday to barely texting all this week He has said he wants to see me again but has made no effort to actually make plans 

Did he really delete his account or have I been blocked I can still read our conversation but its been moved to the bottom of the queue Even though his name is now Deleted account and his profile is gone I can still search his name in my match queue and find our old convo 

It seems he additionally deletedunmatched on Tinder from months ago

Just feeling really hurt Dont know if hes just being nice by saying he wants to see me again and softly ghosting or if hes had a busy week highly demanding job  but its never been a problem before and has deleted dating apps because he genuinely wants to just see me

I like to look through the profile review posts and a lot of the critique on biosprompts are that they are generic or boring and the advice given is usually generally make yourself stand out by showing how youre special This advice usually also never has any actual examples and when the user being reviewed asks for some a lot of the responses are that they should write it themselves Im not trying to copy anyone elses profile and I am not asking anyone to write my prompts for me but I do want to see exactly what others are writing The general vague advice to write about what makes you unique just isnt helpful because I need actual examples if Im going to learn how to do it correctly Would anyone like to share biosprompts that they came up with and legitimately think are really good,0,791

Hot gym bro Youre good looking but almost certainly a fvckboi I think you swiped on me one accident So I will reflect on whether your idea of a good time is my idea of a non nekkid good time and whether you mean situationship when you said looking for a relationship 

Does anyone else keep people in their beeline contemplating matching Or even debate when swiping on OLD and end up swiping left on everyone I make everything an overly cerebral process but I feel like matching only to have the dood unmatch or be super interesting for a few exchanges and then taper off is worse than just writing pleasant narratives in my mind and visiting the person I created a few times a day

"So I met this guy on Bumble went out a couple times and he even invited me to his house he cooked a nice meal and we had even made plans go on a small trip with a couple of friends Everything seemed alright not fantastic but pretty good in my view and all of a sudden I stopped hearing from him I assumed I had been ghosted and wasnt so sure why Anyone who has been ghosted understands how it feels Granted I also had my doubts about this guy but being ghosted like that with no explanation was eating me up 

Sooo I did my research and it seems like there is consensus that you should just let it go Dont text back Dont double text Hes not worth it But this just wasnt sitting right with me So once I built up the courage analyzed everything that could go wrong ie not getting a reply what would it feel like if I got a mean reply etc and when I was finally ready and OK with each one of those scary scenarios I texted him a pretty friendly message asking if I should read his silence as a loss in interest I did add a little compliment and left the door open just in case this was a case of him being too shy or busy 

Regardless of this reply what I would like to emphasize is how a m a z i n g it felt to just send those couple of texts Being ghosted absolutely gutted me and reaching out to him was a way for me to feel in control and empowered I immediately felt lighter and better about myself 

I thought Id share because all the advice I read on being ghosted was basically just ghost back For me texting back was therapeutic",0,1534

He lives in a big city and I live in a suburb about an hour with traffic outside of the city I told him Id understand if he didnt want to pursue anything due to the distance and he said he didnt mind the inconvenience We set up a date for this weekend in the city in his neighborhood and only recently have I started getting pretty severe anxiety about it Im getting anxious about the idea of driving into the city to an area Im unfamiliar with where there is only street  garage parking so I wont have quick access to my car if anything goes awry My friends and family wont be able to help easily if anything goes south on the date either He hasnt given me any red flags about being creepy or weird but you never know and as a woman theres always that thought in the back of your mind I feel bad for questioning this so soon to the date especially since I agreed to it but I only recently started getting a bad feeling about it when thinking about being in an unfamiliar far away location with a stranger getting drinks

So would the best bet be to explain my anxiety surrounding the situation and seeing what he thinks and says about everything or come up with an excuse to cancel and just cut our losses from there I feel bad and silly about getting so worked up about this but its really just a safety concern as all other Bumble dates I had were more so local and at locations that I was at least somewhat familiar with",0,1655

So what does this mean was my account lockeddeleted I can safely say beyond a shadow of a doubt I have never had a bad interaction on Bumble so its not as if Ive been reported and Bumble has taken action on my account since there would be absolutely no reason for any of that to occur

"So most lonely males have probably figured this out the hard way That online dating just doesnt work for them try and try Wait and wait new pics maybe delete and start over Nothings working 

Ask for advice maybe you want some advice from women on how to improve women dont owe you advice ohhh woops uhm 

women dont owe you human decency its all your fault your alone women simply dont make mistakes 

oh oh ok calm down just wondering how 

THERE IS NO HOW WOMEN DONT WANT YOU AND ITS YOUR FAULT 

so whats going on here uhm have you tried improving your profile hmmmmm the woman asks sarcastically automatically assuming you havent does it list exciting hobbies that coincidentally benefit the women trying to date you including but not limited to investments crypto currency stocks having private jets and traveling over seas independently 

meanwhile take a look at womens profiles they ARE ALL THE SAME just open up ur dating app and swipe right on a couple profiles food netflix OH WOW interesting women we have here 

not womens faults they can do the bare minimum and get dates youre just not WORKING hard enough they use the term working because working implies money and you get it now dont you 

as a lonely man it really is sad to say the only option is to simply give up Women will comment when you say that and be like good you should give up things like that because its a collective intention of getting men they see as undesirable off the dating market 

Now of course women will say NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME but we can generalize why because it is 100 feasible that as a whole there is INTERESTS that benefit all of women kind when certain behaviors are benefiting ALL women you can generalize They see alienating and ostracizing certain men as a benefit to all women so them being harsh rude whatever is all encouraged collectively",0,1853

Given the successfailure of rate of of online experiences decades ago Ive never joined Bumble the app I joined Bumble Reddit in hopes of learning something So far most of what Ive read are screenshots which are admittedly good for laughs

Are there many Bumble success stories  or is online dating as confusing and complicated today as it was twenty years ago

"I live in a decent size  military town and know there are at least a thousand if not a few thousand men that would fall in my filters I have a distance of 20 miles and age range of 3339 I even took off the verified profile 

My beeline reached 50 within an hour or two so its not me or my profile My beeline is mainly filled from a very large city about an hour away I dont understand why it wont show me anyone local 

It will show me one profile most of the time and then say to expand my filters In one week I should have been able to swipe more than 200 profiles by now with it being a new account

"Hi

I know there are like 10000 threads with the same topic in the internet But it feels so weird to me right now I have to write it down

I matched with a girl three days ago and we wrote deep in the night on the first two days I never felt so connected to a woman before on a dating app She told me how much she likes to chat with me and made me other compliments

After we wished good night to each other I wrote her yesterday in the evening how her day was but she didnt answer According to her location changes I assume that she did use Bumble since I messaged her

I dont want to be creepy or something but Id really like to continue chatting with her Should I double message her And what would be something good to write after my previous message

Roommates Im 31 Where did this question even come from

That was an immediate turnoff for me because I saw it as an innocent question and life is expensive so I wouldnt judge anyone for trying to cut costs I have a career but I still live with my parents while I try to save

"Hi all Im looking maybe just for some pointers or perspectives from men and women fuck it on this

Ive read a lot about what opinions there are of single moms on these platforms A lot of concerns that I see are 1 child will come first no matter what to the point of neglecting the partner 2 women looking for a father for their kids 3 men feeling uncomfortable with the presence of another man in their lives 

Im kind of in a situation where after a 5 year relationship almost 4 years of marriage I had been pretty isolated from friends and now no longer have a friend group to meet people IRL really I dont plan on hopping on bumble or tinder or anything for at least a year but have been thinking about the future moving forward a lot 

I guess from my perspective ive never seen the whole putting kid first thing to be an issue because Ive never had a situation where I need to choose between my child or someone else I generally dont schedule any time to see people or hang out on days I have my kid and if I do I put him in daycare so I can have a day Im not looking for a father for my children they have one and its a positive coparenting relationship with no baby daddy drama that would interfere with anything and himampI only talk about the spawn and only see each other for pick up and drop off of spawn 

I dont think anyone who doesnt want to deal with someone elses kids should be forced to do so People absolutely have the right to not want to date someone with children and Ive got no issue with that Prior to having children myself I wouldnt have wanted to date a single parent either 

So my question is for those who are willing to date parents what types of things do you look for in a prospective partner whos also a parent that communicates to you that the children wont be problematic for you What are ways I can communicate the fact that i know and accept my children are 110 my responsibility and Im not trying to push that onto prospective partners without seeming like a pick me kinda bitch What are red and green flags you look for when it comes to a single parent 

The last time I was in the dating scene I was like 20 and had no kids and no real life experience with anything So this is kinda new For me 

TIA",0,2241
I clicked on the superswipe icon on a profile Because I didnt have any it switched to the screen where I could purchase some I purchased a small pack Then it automatically went back to the swipe screen and swiped right on the profile it also explicitly said superswiped I thought all is well But when I checked my profile I still have all the superswipes left that I just purchased So I think they either gave me a free superswipe or the system didnt actually register a superswipe for that profile Anyone else faced this issue,0,527
"So I matched with a very pretty girl and we talked on the phone a few times  My best friend saw her profile and observed Thats a guy

I dont see it  OK she maybe has a strong jaw for a woman but other than that the looks perfectly feminine and nothing about her voice or conversation seemed male

So I am over at my mothers house for lunch the next day and I am sort of brooding over this  I have a theory that women are better at spotting men ever since watching The Crying Game with my wife who did not understand the point of the movie because Jay Davidson was so obviously a man so I figure Ill show her the picture without prompting see what she says

What she says is Uh uh and starts laughing

I put the phone away  Yeah that is what Dale said too

On the other hand she reflected  Maybe that would be good for you right now

Now my mom is openminded for a woman in her mid80s but that is very openminded  Plus I cannot imagine what about right now or about me would make a fling with a guy off the Internet a particularly good thing for me right now

Mom what exactly do you think is the issue

You know what Dale said

"Ive been on Bumble for almost two months Finally met a really nice guy and weve been talking for a while We talked by phone and text on and off throughout the day and at night Weve met up for dinner and hung out and everything seems great He left for a weeklong vacation to Florida with family on Friday Friday morning is the last time he sent me a text Im not trying to be the overthinking crazy person as some women are labeled However we were fine up until his trip and he made comments such as he was going to be sending me pics from the pool and picking on me as I have to work all week and will definitely be texting 

I didnt hear anything from him when his plane landed so I just assumed he got there and on Saturday I sent him a text saying hey I hope you are having a great time I didnt hear anything from him when his plane landed so I just assumed he got there and on Saturday I sent him a text saying hey I hope you are having a great time and I still havent heard back

Im not trying to sound stupid but Im just trying to understand if we were talking every day for weeks why would he just stop talking to me even just to say hi or check in while on vacation I am not trying to sound like I need to be in constant contact with him or vice versa but wouldnt you think hed at least text esp since he pointed out that he would

"Feels bad man

I guess all the warning signs were there

 she deleted her Bumble account as soon we were talking by SMS
 she was way too affectionate way too fast
 she didnt want to talk on the phone only text
 her written English was nonnative Slavic I would guess by her trouble with plurals and articles but in the video she sent me she had an American accent

In defense of my intelligence I will say it was a skillfully done scam

 she had a variety of photos of herself and used them appropriately to the situation
 she spent a lot of time on me before even trying to set the hook
 she picked a very specific job broker for home solar installation  I wonder if that was a setup for a later part of the scam or if the scammer had really worked in that industry

"First off let me apologize since I know this subject has been addressed here  But I just want to make sure I am understanding this correctly  I have been a paid male member of Bumble since March  So far my matches have been few and far between and rarely do I even get anyone in my Bee Line  After discussing the issue with some folks I was advised to take a look at my settings filters which are pretty much wide open  I currently have my age range capped at 46 on the upper end  I am 47  Just for fun I bumped it up 10 years  And low and behold a bunch of women in their early 50s pop up into my Bee Line  I throttle the age filter back and they disappeared  Push it back up and they are there

So now I understand that through my filter selections I am not just filtering who I see new when meeting new people  But also who appears in my Bee Line that have swiped right on me  I assume this same functionality applies to other filters such as distance  If that is the case then if I am seeking women out 99 miles away and swiping right on them unless they have their distance filter set to match mine they wont see me in their Bee Line and have no idea I swiped right  In other words if they only want to meet men 20 miles away or less I will not show up to them because I am 60 miles away  Is this thought process correct

If so then Bumble is 100 useless to me  As I have mentioned in other posts here I live in a small town  I am lucky to see a dozen or so profiles within a dozen miles of me  The next two fairly sizable cities are 50 miles away then the next several are nearly 100 miles away  From conversations I have had with women in these areas they are looking for men within 20 miles  This leaves me out   20 miles from me are cornfields and the side of a mountain",0,1779

So the hyper gamia says 90 of females pick only 10 of men so that top 10 of men are getting 90 of womens attention Men and women are labeled by numbers from 1 to 10 based on looks and wealth So if you swipe right 10 handsome men looking wealthy the ones who show a boat traveling dress fancy etc you need to be aware they get tons of messages each day 
If you swipe right a guy who is not as handsome and not as rich he may get one swipe right once a week and on his mind he is thinking maybe you are the one Just to realize you will not choose him because he also needs to have his game on Like great conversation have a job etc and he will be walking on eggshells

Just trying to understand how the dating behaviour is I moved to N america and where I come from its not racially diverse South Asian if that matters Its really diverse here which I like I hear all the time people pairing up from different culturesraces here But i dont know how that works on these apps 

Im tired of dating people from my own culture I know the mentality very well The ones Ive met on the app havent been that great and a lot of them have incel energy for some reason Idk and the others seem okay but dont bother having a proper conversation or arent looking for similar things 
I personally dont mind getting to know other cultures or whatever I know therell be a learning gap for both since its essentially being introduced to another foreign culture

Now Im sure she had better options and I dont take it hard However for learning purposes Im wondering if I could have done anything differently to elevate my position on her list Was I too passive  Should I have fought harder somehow  I was trying to be gentle in my silence breakers and I know being a prick is a huge nono but would being wittier and less vanilla have made a big difference  Since we did eventually pin down a call time I figured I would defer bantercontent to then so I did not chat leading up to the call Was this a mistake  Im trying to avoid this from happening with another match so any advice would be greatly appreciated  Thanks",0,1269

"Match 1
She was pretty cute and we started talking for maybe a couple of hours on bumble Now shes not the only match Im talking to I talk to several women because Im trying to find the perfect match for a date I assume everyone does this I mean why wouldnt you right Well lo and behold turns out Im also talking to a friend of hers She immediately informs me that I belong to her and I have to stop talking to all my matches ASAP Of course I was done with her right there That was a red flag for me

Match 2
This one to me was the worst Within hours of matching she began to send me videos of her didling herself She wanted to meet up right away but I cant during my work days So we talked for a couple days Then one day I became swamped at work Im talking 14 hours and no break Couldnt even touch my phone I was so busy She proceeded to flip out in her mind She posted to all of her social media that Im too far out of your league for your ugly ass to treat me like this motherf Good luck finding someone else like me Now I was never attracted to her Her profile was misleading and filled with angles and filters I saw her Facebook and how she really looked and I wasnt attracted However I felt it would be too shallow of me to dismiss her because of her looks I thought maybe she could be a potentially great woman Well her little comment about me on multiple social media accounts sent up more red flags than China during a parade I popped smoke and broke contact Thats military for I got out of there real quick 

Match 3
The same day we began talking she started sending me screenshots between her and her ex husband She constantly talked about how much she hated him and how shes going for full custody because he doesnt deserve to be a dad and bla bla bla For the record both a father and a mother are equally important to a child A child deserves equal and unrestricted access to both parents I feel for her children Anyways her non stop bashing on her ex husband was my cue to bail

Not to mention all of the ones you match me with that are not being honest or have a very bad sense of transparency if they even have a good motive I can imagine the woman get one perspective of this that absolutely sucks And yes the men get another perspective that equally sucks 
I am settling for that wholesome connection and acquaintance that just feels right and good Like it was meant to beyes maybe Im setting my standard high but honestly what else do I have to lose besides not downloading another dating app ever again The same thing happens over and over again To those that have found their match on dating apps I salute you I just know that my experience and wasted time trying to find that connection outweighs the potential of what I want for my life",0,1295
"Im 40M new to Bumble and OLD in general but based on my understanding I decided to take the following approach

1 Subscribe to Premium its worth the lt20 to perform this experiment
2 Fill out my profile 4 pics all 3 prompts bio no Spotify or Instagram and enter Incognito Mode
3 Spend a few hours selectively swiping right on at least 200 women who match my interests the largest criteria being not wanting kids or at least not saying they want kids I do not want kids but I leave it blank on mine to widen the net a little
4 wait 1 day and see if I get any matches back from this 200 who are the only people who can see my profile due to Incognito Mode

The big assumption here is that when I swipe right in Incognito Mode Bumble will deliver my profile to that person in some reasonable timeframe and thus I will get a chance to be swiped on by those 200 people

The results were of course disappointing 3 matches one chat that didnt go anywhere likely due to a pretty significant ageculture difference Im assuming the vast majority of the rest were indeed shown my profile and they swiped left

My conclusion is that OLD is not for me Id say I was reasonable in my rightswipesI did not focus on Instagram modeltypes if anything avoided them and tried to be true to my interests I was selective but I create a pool of at least 200 which should be a decent sample size They were generally attractive but reasonably in line with whom I have attracted in person

I know Im new to this but I already feel like Im out of my sincerity comfort zone trying to incorporate all kinds of advice about OLD profiles Ive had some success meeting people in person WAY better batting average than lt3 out of 200 its just slow and inefficient I thought technology would make things more efficient but its looking more and more like the swipeworld just creates a hurdle that is even more cumbersome for me to surmount than meeting people IRL

I kindly told him that we dont share the same values He proceeded to call me a snicker licker and other obscenities I am so disgusted Like I am a white female and I date any man I can connect with Whether its black white asian and anything and everything inbetween I mean its 2021 for fucks sake   Im very sad and disgusted I shouldnt let these ignorant comments get to me But he proceeded to post under my Instagram posts these same obscenities Luckily he blocked me so they are gone   


Im just very shaken up that this has happened",0,869
"Say i get a match they usually ignore me Or unmatch me or are mean 

So lets ignore all that and just say im tired of bullshitting around with the dating apps and putting in so so so much effort to be ignored and so on 

So we just lay it out on the table like this 

Excuse me I hope this isnt rude but may I ask you out on a date 

Would that be considered bad",0,362
"Hey folks

ampx200B

I started using dating apps again last month after the pandemic with an entirely different attitudeapproach to using them Ive gotten significantly more matches and am getting dates plural with this approach than I ever got before My theory is that it will help you a lot if you practice swiping discipline which basically means thinking critically about whether swiping on this person helps or hurts your overall chances of matching with someone worthwhile Note that my advice is mostly for Bumble and Hinge since they operate similarly

ampx200B

Heres what Ive found helps get you higher in the stack and more visible to people who actually will match back with you and want to message you

ampx200B

1 Do not swipe right on people who are clearly out of your league The fantasy is nice but theres basically zero chance they will both match with you and want to carry on a conversationrelationship with you when they are getting drowned with likes from everybody Youre just hurting your statistics for no real benefit

ampx200B

2 Do not swipe right on people who do not have a profile or who have extremely basic one word answers to everything A profile like this signifies one or more things

 That they are able to get matches easily and so therefore do not need to put effort into their bio see logic behind 1 
 That they are not actually all that interested in datingdating seriously and use the app more for validationego purposes
 That they have difficulty carrying on a conversation via textare difficult to communicate with via text This doesnt make them bad people per se but its hard to make a genuine connection leading to an inperson encounter when their responses are one or two words  something thats a lot more likely if their profile is barren

3 Do not swipe on people who put their instagramsnapchat addresses in their bios  its not always true but these tend to be people who are not really on the app for romantic purposes

ampx200B

4 Be more discriminating in evaluating each profile  look for reasons why you dont want to swipe on them rather than the other way round If they arent someone whos really caught your eye with a shared interestsense of humor and are just someone you think is acceptably attractive there are a lot of criteria you could use to justify not swiping Distance from you lack of shared interests age differential blandness of their prompt responses etc You dont have to be super picky but keep in mind that these lesser criteria are also how discerning users usually women decide how to pick who to interact with  they have many more potential matches to comb through 

ampx200B

5 DO swipe on people who you are iffy on physically but who share many of your interestshave compatible bios They are much more likely to swipe back and even if you ultimately decide not to pursue them further having made the match counts as a positive for you and them in the algos 

ampx200B

I think a lot of guys get caught up in trying to swipe as many people as possible or trying to minmax their profile you can see mine in my reddit history for comparisons I dont claim to have a perfect solution or method here but I think its worth discussing things like this rather than getting caught up in recriminations against the app or women or oneself",0,3303
But Ive had this account up for about a week and Ive only been liked by two people Now Im not trying to sound like a dickhead here but Im an attractive guy Im 64 muscular nice face Id give myself a solid 8 out of 10 My bio is pretty normal my pictures are pretty normal Now this is an old account that I just started using again and I did used to have premium so could that be the issue Im not saying I expect droves of likes or anything but it seems like SOMETHING is fucked up because Ive had MUCH better luck before,0,518
"I am tired of being told it isnt and tired of being told to get over it That women can treat me how they want and do what they want 

they use contradictions to shame me and have 1000 methods of doing it 

no you dont get laid because you THINK about sex men who get sex dont think about sex 

ok how do i never think about getting sex 

DID YOU JUST SAY getting SEX you dont GET SEX NOBODY DOES meanwhile some guy is destroying this girl from behind 

They claim sex is something that nobody should think about but then I read books by women for women or at least from the perspective of women Ive done this with a bunch of books I like women authors The thing is it opens up my mind to how women think things women will bullshit me on and lie to me on in real life and on reddit When women communicate with each other its a different story and turns out they ARENT all asexual like they say I should be hmmmmm 

So ive read the bell jar by sylvia plath shes one of my favorite authors The main character judges men harshly but when you hear things that are romantic its really heart warming I didnt think women could feel affection or feel desire until I read this book 

Why why did I think women couldnt feel those things Because women told me they DONT Women told me I have to be asexual to attract women because being attracted to women is wrong 

The main character literally has hook up sex with  a stranger while shes on leave from a mental asylum WOMEN HATE SEX WOMEN NEVER THINK ABOUT SEX has hook up sex yeah ok 

Ive had bumble for nearly a year now and women absolutely treat me like garbage on it same with other dating sites the women claim I deserve it I deserve to suffer So on so forth that im suffering because of my personality when they played a part in developing who I am 

I read the unwomanly face of war a book written by a woman who interviews other women so no male influence here at all and the women literally risked their livelihoods to be with men at times Would talk about how handsome some men were compared to others and im shamed for saying I think a girls cute REALLY 

Im reading the hand maids tale im sure youve heard of it in it she literally fantasizes about men undressing her she fantasizes about these men being FUCKING HORNY and masturbating against a wall 

and im wrong im WRONG for being attracted to women",0,2356
"I 26f was talkingseeing this guy 24m I met on bumble We matched in April and he took me out to dinner He seemed to be normal very hard working and family oriented He had told me prior to meeting that his dad who he was very close to was in the hospital from falling down the stairs and rupturing a few discs in his back He told me hes also been taking care of his little brother who hes also very close to whos 10 years old while his dads in the hospital His stepmom married to his father apparently went ghostMIA on the father and her 10 year old son because her parents were also sick and dying in the hospital He told me hed be his fathers main caregiver after his father gets out of the hospital as his fathers in rough shape He also told me that hed be taking on his fathers medical bills as his father was in a sticky situation with his work and had little to no health insurance
 
A few weeks after our first date we also hung out one more time after our first date his father got released from the hospital We made plans to get a hotel and stay overnight for the weekend He told me hed get a babysitter for his brother Well that Saturday rolls around and I havent really heard from him and so I send him a text confirming our plans and he had told me his father had passed away after just coming home from a few days prior I send my condolences and give him his space as I cant imagine what hes going through

He calls me at 3AM the day his father passed He was drinking and said hes had a crazy day with his dad passing and everything and just wanted a normal conversation He was drinking and driving and I told him he shouldnt be doing that and I offered for him to stay over my house rather than drinking and driving around aimlessly So he comes over around 4am and stayed over till the next day

In between him taking care of his little brother and his father passing away he tells me hes moving into a new apartment to be closer to his work on top of making funeral arrangements which he claims hes paying for One day he FaceTimed me and told me that he was house sitting his sisters apartment because she went to Florida My first question to him was why is your sister going to Florida when both of your father just passed away And he said idk I guess its her way of coping Seemed odd to me but I didnt question the rest of it

What also seemed weird to me was that he told me he was moving into his new apartment the day of his fathers funeral Like how do you have the time to move into a new spot and attend a funeral He also said his sister because she went to Florida and step mother did not attend his fathers funeral which seems wild to me The day of his fathers funeral he calls me around 9pm tells me hes still packing up some stuff for his new apartment He asked if he could sleep over that night at my house I told him sure

A week or so goes by were still regularly FaceTiming but then I noticed he wasnt texting me as much I send him a message telling him I hope youre doing ok and Im thinking of you and he apologizes for being MIA as this past month has been hectic but he still misses me though I let it be I dont hear from him for a week but he posted on Snapchat So I send him last text saying hi just thinking of you I know things have been hectic for you etc And nothing ghosted 

Whats weird to me is that I dont think his dad really died There was no obituary online or in the newspaper His own sister didnt attend her fathers funeral Why did he move into a brand new apartment the day of his fathers funeralwho has time to do all of that in one day Oh and I looked up his fathers LinkedIn and he is still active on it liking different peoples posts Its ironic because his father has a pretty high up position at an insurance companyhow does your father not have insurance to cover medical bills Idk seems kinda sketchy to me",0,3860
"I get that the notifications are sometimes dated but usually they are based on the current day So if she messaged me within the current day and I answered I still get the notification There was however no communication today The last message was yesterday evening and it came from me

This is not about a new match or someone who unmatched me but about a girl that Ive been writing with for a week btw

Is it possible that the message somehow disappeared Does it pop up a bit later or is this perhaps a bug I did clear the cache and even opened the web client but there is no new message Just my last one from yesterday evening",0,627

I saw a coworker on the app but didnt swipe right because I thought it would be awkward if the feeling werent mural Fast forward to today He came in an gave a presentation since hes out union rep and he was starting at me the whole time I think he obviously remembered me from the app Im just wondering how often do you see girls on there that stand out enough for you to recognize them in public We live in a large metropolitan area with 3 mil people,0,451

"I 32M matched with a lady 34Fa few weeks ago and we were sending videos of each other back and forth while I was out on my nightly walk She noticed I was literally 2 streets away from her we happen to live THAT close so she asked if I wanted to hang on her front porch and I agreed 

We had a great conversation and I was into her She was asking great questions to get to know me and truly seemed like she was listening to what I was saying and me back to her

So a few days later she texts me good morning Im glad youre not a liar like other guys 
Confused I asked what she meant and apparently her brother is married to a pretty famous person here in LA and they have a private investigator on retainer and she took all of the things I had said and asked him to look into it all on top of running a full background check of me 

Now I have nothing to hide but I was still a little unnerved by this 
She keeps saying youre upset about it That means youre hiding something he didnt find What is it 
And assures me this is perfectly normal and everyone does it She even encouraged me to hire one of my own on her and do a background check and such 

Thoughts Is this odd IS this a normal thing everyone does Im pretty new to online dating 

I can see the point of wanting to know something about someone but a background check A PI",0,1330

I was just swiping and got two matches I sent a message to one of them and then the other match disappeared from the timer Did this guy unmatch me after about 1 minute of my matching with him or is this a glitch Something similar happened to a guy that matched with me a couple days ago The time definitely did not run out on either of these Is it safe to assume I was unmatched in both of these cases,0,401

"Especially when they already told you that they were in a bad place physically and under a lot of stress literally when you first started talking 

I simply texted a guy I was starting to see that in addition to having randomly thrown up on an empty stomach that morning that I was starting to feel like I was having a panic attack and was taking myself to the ER Figure that anxiety is common enough that most people know that an anxiety attack isnt the end of the world I wasnt suicidal or felt like selfharming It simply felt like I was trying to climb a wall and couldnt even muster the strength to lift my arms over my head because I lost all motivation to do anything but heart would not stop pounding 

Didnt call him crying while he was at work didnt ask him to get me 

I just took my ass to the hospital and got my shit sorted Normally I could talk myself down from oncoming panic attacks but this was too much It was agonizing making the decision to ask for help by even just going to the ER 

My boss and coworkers understood My teachers understood 

But evidently this was getting too emotional for a dude who literally said the day prior when I was complaining about not having eaten or slept well for 3 days that he was here for me Its almost like a nonexistent appetite and an overactive brain fucks you up from all angles or something

I truly believe that a stranger wouldve acted with more decency if they were actually witnessing someone having a panic attack as opposed to just literally hearing about it second hand and not actually being expected to do anything like in this case 

But honestly Im minded to think that part of the anxiety was hypervigilance kicked into overdrive since homie turned out to be a toxic piece of shit He kept bringing up how uncomfortable his gay friend he absolutely had to emphasize that his friend was gay whenever referenced made him with his advances yet also copped to inviting the attention 

Seemed like one of those people who tells on themselves pretty easily because they dont understand the implications of the shit they say or just what words mean in general

"This keeps happening to me and its frustrating Something I love about bumble is that I can list a lot of things about myself in my profile Then I can see on other peoples profiles if we have common values For example do we both want children share the same religious beliefs political beliefs etc
However not everybody uses these features

But Im a bit frustrated that people will see things listed know its a dealbreaker for them and match with me anyhow
For example I dont want to date somebody with children so I always swipe left on people who have it listed in their profile This saves us both time Please do the same for me especially if you arent going to fill out your bio enough for me to know what your values are

I know I cant be alone in this But dating is frustrating enough as is if there is something on my profile you dont like just swipe left I dont even understand why theyre swiping right in the first place if theyre just going to tell me a few days later that there are too many dealbreakers for this to work The dealbreakers being things listed on my profile

Then if it does go well Im also the one who has to ask them out and make the plans They never have the initivative to Im all for making the first move but I definitely dont want to be the dominant one in the relationship either making all the plans and moves I wanna be desired a little A lot of the time when I ask them out they say something like theyre busy and will get back to me This app is exhausting Im going back to Tinder",0,1171

"I have a date with a guy Ive been talking to for about a week probably and at first I was excited for it but now when I think about the fact that I have a day off tomorrow I imagine myself reading and listening to music and then I realise I have a date and Id rather kms

Its not that I dont like him its just that Id rather stop breathing than go on a date with someone Ive never met especially when it could go terribly and then Id have wasted a day off by spending 2 hours or more outside my house not to mention the bus journey I despise buses

Am I just displaying the typical signs of predate nerves or should I cancel It doesnt exactly help that I have 2 very busy weeks if work ahead of me and thats all Im thinking about rn so Id really like to make the most of my free time while I can and spending a day with someone I dont know requires a lot of mental energy I dont think I have

I feel like it would be shitty to cancel now at 11pm the night before but we havent even agreed on a time and the fact that he hasnt messaged me all day makes me feel a bit better about the idea of just saying oopsie no bueno looks like tomorrow wont work for me

I think this was more a rant than anything but Id still like someone to pretend to consider it and then tell me to cancel like I want to do

Maybe if I just dont message him tomorrow hell think I died ",0,1358
"I cringe at small talk but also understand its necessity

After a few back and forth general questions based on someones initial message or prompts I usually ask where theyre based and if theyre nearby Ill say something like oh nice I live in  maybe we could go for a drink sometime

Or Ill ask what theyre up to next week and say something like maybe we could go for a drink on Thursday if youre free

Given the nature of this platform these are women who have initiated mutual contact with me so must be interested to some extent and we often have a good back and forth between 24 days of one message a day but 4 out of 5 times after I ask them to actually go for a drink they stop responding

Im moreso curious than anything  It seems like things have been going well so Im doubting she blocked me but thats the only other possible explanation I can think of",0,628

I do not lie in bed responding to guys But I notice Im having a great convo and they completely stop responding because poor them  I made them wait a whole sleeping night to respond Or I dont respond immediately when I wake up I might respond at noon and I already stop getting responses These guys arent even asking me out I just notice now that Ive grown and changed in certain areas people really still do expect you to sit there and entertain them all day 


It just sucks because Ive been unmatched or just stopped responded to for just completely trying to disciplined and stick to my daily schedule

"This is a bit of a rant so discretion is advised
So I just bought boost for 1 month for first time first of all they only give you 1 stoplight for the whole month plus just 5 superlikes which is same to one week subscription of boost afaik which is completely stupid plus it is not clear on the app

So I know I should have done better research before buying it so I guess it is my fault

But my main rant is about spotlight as I have mentioned above this was my first purchase on Bumble and I will as keen to use the spotlight function so I accidentally clicked it and BAM with no pop up to ask if I want to start it or not
Spotlight started at 1 pm and I am laughing here in disbelief like fuck my life

TLDR  Accidentally popped Spotlight at 1 pm and app didnt even ask to confirm whether I wanted to use it or not which feels like a scam for a first time user

"Yall I cant get anybody to meet me IRL Am I the only one 

Im a 36 year old woman reasonably attractive feel like I get a decent number of matches Im open to possibilities as far as relationshipscasual hookups are on the table but Im definitely open to more serious connections if its a good fit My main goal on Bumble is to match with attractive people who share a couple of my interests to MEET IN REAL LIFE and see how we vibe 

All of these men flake on me when we are supposed to meet  Why 

Its always something cheapfree and lowpressure like meeting in a park or grabbing coffeetea 

I behave like a normal human with good boundaries when messaging Im responsive but dont message excessively  Basically just have a little small talk suggest meeting in person agree on datetimelocation and say Im looking forward to meeting them 

Flakes All of them 

Sigh 

I guess this is the part where I should mention Im a sex worker and Im upfront about it on my profile I know thats a major contributing factor in my dating difficulties But still if my job is a dealbreaker why would you match with me chat with me and make plans with me only to flake andor ghost I get that people might not want to marry me but is it that scary to take a damn walk with me and chat for an hour And if it is why not swipe left unmatch me or not reply to my messages 

The flaking makes me want to give up ",0,1386
"I personally have found all dating appssites to more or less be clones of one another with variances in how many people Im allowed to like and who Im allowed to see expressed even the mildest interest in me but Bumble seems a little more aggressive in limiting information and I want to be sure Im just not oblivious to certain things others have no problem with

I cant read anything about a woman except their name and their job title if they put it but not if its too long that it cuts off midway with  as clicking ANYWHERE on a profile immediately pops up a screen trying to get me to pay for an premium account making trying to find common ground to help me find something to talk about that much harder for no reason should anyone actually open up communication with me in the first place

Then Ive been reading a few of the other posts here and see options that Ive certainly not come across Exactly how much more can you expand your profile if you pay a subscription I know its just a marketing gimmick but does anyone REALLY go through all that Is there a subculture if you will of women who ONLY contact people if they see those details only a subbed account is privy to filling details for Am I basically dodging bullets with what could technically be perceived as predatory women who are looking for men with money to burn

On top of that theres no read receipts as far as I can tell Well as someone who at least has a general understanding that despite the fairer sex having the priority of control one would imagine that they likely still have opened up talks with enough multiple people to be a little swamped so maybe those who have initiated a howdydo with me simply put that out there and possibly just never got back to me when theres so many others that have piqued their interest

I put my best foot forward have no expectations of reciprocation spelling but feel lost when I genuinely have no idea if what Ive responded with was even looked at I dont mind the swipe culture because boredom and instant gratification has been the name of the game for YEARS when it comes to online dating I just want to have some kind of direction to better understand what I should do and not make random assumptions which benefits nobody

Finally every couple days I either get an email or a notification bar from the app itself that implies theres activity but the gist of it almost always boils down to pay to be seen more Well when Ive swiped less than 3 dozen women within a VERY generous range of age and distance Im 32 and have gone 27 to 50 distance within 80 kilometres am I supposed to read the room as theres just no one in the area using the app besides mostly men or is the app just throttling me trying to hold me hostage until I pony up

Im sure Im missing a lot of minor details Ive noticed but these have been all the major concerns thus far and I just want to be sure I actually get whats happening For my personal situation uninstall 

I dont mind waiting for more of the COVID fear to die down as more people get vaccinated Im booked to get my first shot soon so that I can be struck down directly to my face but the options have always been slim Other apps a certain flammable one in particular have authoritarian algorithms which automatically banned accounts which were NOT sexual violent or portray any kind of illegal activity in any way nor did I misrepresent myself or use copyrighted materials

1 When a guy matches with someone he gets a youve matched screen which asks him  if he wants to continue swiping  Why  Its not like he can start the conversation  Is the presumption that there are guys out there who upon getting a match wait with bated breath for the stars to align with that person and dont swipe again until that happens

"Hes not in my city at the moment but hell be coming back in a few weeks Right now hes visiting his parents we talked on the phone once already and he wants to talk 1 or 2 times a week I dont love talking on the phone because I feel like I dont get a sense of the person unless we meet IRL but I guess he doesnt want me to forget about him if its going to be weeks until we actually meet and thats why he wants to keep talking on the phone The one phone conversation weve had so far was kind of awkward mostly because of me as Im not good at phone convos and kept accidentally interrupting him I did find his questions to be very rapid fire and almost like a job interview and they werent all easy questions either lol some were more like whats your most embarrassing moment

I told him Im not looking for anything serious and he said thats fine cause hes leaving in a few months for grad school but the phone calls and the way he always compliments me and tells me Im adorable and sends me pictures of his day are making me think hes wanting that He asked me to come up with things to tell his parents about why he keeps being on the phone for example In a joking way Im unsure if Im reading too much into this 

One consideration is that hes not really my type even in terms of personality  Im usually more into quiet guys and hes very slick and extroverted and felt like one of those guys who are great at sales lol And so Im scared that if Im not attracted to him when we eventually meet I will have spent all this time leading him on by agreeing to phone calls so Ill owe him something for spending all this time talking to me Its less of a big deal to tell someone sorry theres no chemistry if weve only spent a day talking versus weeks of phone calls",0,1756

Has Bumble gone the way of Tinder in teasing you with fake likes to try and make you pay to get to them Its completely useless if those likes it says I have are there then I should have gotten to at least a couple before I reached my daily quota I even set my age range and distance to max to see if theyd turn up but got nothing",0,715

I met someone who I kind of clicked with and we went on a few dates which helped make feelings real The problem was the feelings became real almost in a vacuum There was just no solid foundation to our connection like a deep history So without that solid foundation as soon as an argument happened we just never seemed to be able to recover Those feelings are still there but he broke things off

So now Im at a point where I could redownload bumble have another couple dozen or hundred conversations and hope one works But chances are Ill get my heart broken again

Im worried Im supposed to be single forever Im religious and believe in waiting for marriage and I feel like everyone my age or older with the same belief system is already married I loved being married I dont know how to find happiness in being single

I also dont feel like I have time to be single I want kids in my 20s I wanted to have a kid this year Now if I meet someone today date them for a year get engaged for a year be married for a few years before having kids That puts me at 28 to even start having kids and nine months of pregnancy basically puts me at 29 

I just want to feel loved and I cant seem to get people to stay Im sure Im the problem I just dont know how to move forward from here",0,1732
I got a match and we started talking and it seemed like we were hitting it off But right in the middle of me responding to her she unmatched No warning and didnt say anything just boom gone Her profile said she hated small talk I didnt think our conversation was that bland Has this happened to anyone else I also reached out to bumble to see if maybe it was some sort of tech error or something but havent heard anything,0,421

"It seems to me the primary function of Bumble now is to keep people single Time and time again I hear of people with 10 matches in their beeline swiping whenever they can and never matching with anyone Of course theres no way to prove this but my theory is that Bumble is hiding these matches in order to coax people in to paying for premium Now of course the app is out to make money That goes without saying theyre still a business at the end of the day However when the app reaches a point of having little interest in actually matching people and is only interested in making money I think its outlived its usefullness   


Id like to add that I first started using Bumble around the end of the Summer of 2020 and found a fair amount of success on it However once JanuaryFebruary hit the matches completely died off I tried adding to my age range my location limit Still nothing I tried to follow advice on this subreddit I fully filled out my profile I ignored the app for two days before going back to it Nothing Those matches in the beeline never showed up

"I got a notification to rematch with a guy who let my message expire maybe he was busy idk I accidentally clicked off and the notification frustratingly disappeared

"Long story short I met her on Bumble I dated her for 8 months We dated casually for a while Then I believed we were dating  exclusively for almost 4 months That ended about a week ago Early one morning I watched her take money from my wallet when she thought I was sleeping I let her leave with the cash  Later that day I broke up with her by text I told her not to come back to my home 

Within a few days of breaking up with her I learned that she had taken embarrassing video of me In an anonymous email I was offered the chance to pay to prevent that content from being released to friends and family colleagues and anyone on the Internet Ive refused to pay There are many many more details to this story Its the most insane thing that has ever happened to me 

Im adding a pic below I chose this pic carefully so that it wouldnt violate this persons right to privacy funny I actually care about that right I hope that it might still provide some warning to anyone out there who is already dating her already I have reliable info that right now she is active on Bumble in Washington DC under the fake name Steph

"Before you post questions like this on OLD pages like Tinder or Bumble heres a page with a lot of interesting data regarding behaviors on Tinder httpswwwbusinessofappscomdatatinderstatisticshttpswwwbusinessofappscomdatatinderstatistics  and most swipebased dating apps follow similar pattern

ampx200B

So before you post pointing a finger at the opposite sex with a hastily generalization it might be good to

1 Wonder what the common denominator with all those behavior the opposite gender you encounter is except the gender that is It start with Y continues with a o and end with a u
2 Check actual usage statistics and confirm if your hunchbias is actually supported by stats If not connecting the dots between Y o amp u might be a good start to see change

Im not blasting people that have honest question to the opposite sex or want feedback and opinions about a situationbehavior But theres just so many snarky posts trying to blame point fingers trying to lecture at the opposite sex disguised as a question And this goes for both of the sexes

"Okay this was about 6 years ago a lifetime in my mind I F25 was dating my first ever boyfriend at the age of 19 I didnt talk much with his sister even though she was only a year younger than me It was only when I agreed to help her practice doing nails for her job that she warmed up to me and stopped hating me I guess she didnt care about me since she knew we wouldnt last and she was right lmao Anyway she had this boyfriend they were together the same amount of time 9 months as my ex and I I only saw him a few of times at family reunions or when hed come over to visit her I remember the day she broke up with him My ex told me the gossip they were on a date and he gave her a present and then she broke it off and he had to take her home after that I saw her and she didnt seem upset she was only thinking about giving away the guinea pig he had given her months ago I was a bit upset he had given it to her as a present its something I dont agree with but he was 19 and in love and seemed genuinely like a sweet guy Then a couple weeks later my ex ghosted me for days  because he had been cheating on me and he broke up with me via text I was heartbroken and never saw him again Though I did find out about a year ago that he stole a lot of money from the girl he left me for so I dodged a bullet there 

So 6 years and 1 relationship later Ive been on bumble for a while but nothing ever happens because Im an introverted socially anxious person I still swipe because Im bored or get lonely so then I saw him I recognized him but wasnt sure He has an unusual name though so it had to be him I hesitated for a long time but swiped left I regretted it immediately though So after a few weeks later hoping to see him again there he was today So I swiped right just to see It was a match Now I hate that I have to initiate the conversation What do I say Hey do you even remember me We both have horrible taste in people Wanna go out Please help 

Also english isnt my first language so I apologize for any errors

Hey everyone 19M here So Ive been talking to this girl for about 23 weeks and we hit it off pretty well Id say We both go to the same university play the same sports and shes one year younger than me We went on our first date last week and I would say that is went pretty well However one of the biggest issues that I found while weve been talking is that she takes absolutely foreverrrrr to respond Like Ill be sending her a snap and she wouldnt respond for like 315 hours I know that people say that when shes texting back it shows shes interested still but Im super conflicted We just agreed on our second date for this Friday and Im super excited about it Its just super conflicting because she engages in the conversation and also agrees to the dateturn on but she also takes forever to respond over snap IG and iMessage turn off I was discussing w my friend about asking her why she takes so long to respond in a polite way but Im afraid that this will sort of come off as a confrontation and then ruin the vibes and potentially the date for Friday I really hope this can work out and maybe develop into a relationship but like every hour that she doesnt respond I feel like I lose that interest and connection Most of my friends said they probably wouldve ended it off already if it were them but like I said I really hope this will work out What do you guys think I should do,0,1383

"I bought 5 spotlights for 1299 Each one gives 30 minutes seriously of boosted visibility for your profile I knew it wouldnt be worth the money but I wanted to experiment because Ive never used any premium features on dating apps

I read that Thursday night and Sunday night between 8pm and 10pm are the times when dating apps are most active so I made sure to try it on those days  I typically average 1 like per day on Bumble My results

 Tuesday at 530pm  4 likes during the boost Followed by 4 likes later that night The timing was an accident because I didnt realize that the first Spotlight started as soon as you purchased it
 Thursday at 815pm  Zero likes Tried again at 9pm because Thursday is supposedly a hightraffic day 2 likes BUT I did receive 6 likes later in the night and woke up to 3 more likes the next morning
 Sunday at 845pm  2 likes Nothing else for the rest of the night
 Wednesday at 850pm  5 likes Followed by 2 more likes later that night

So overall I cant deny that the spotlights did help at least a little bit In addition to the 30 minute boost there seems to be a residual effect where receiving likes leads to more likes for a brief period 

Ultimately not worth the money for me If you have a lot of disposable income though you may as well pay to play

Honestly Id consider buying Bumble Premium if it included 3 spotlights per week instead of 1 It sucks that Bumble is so stingy with Spotlights even if youre willing to shell out cash for a multimonth plan",0,1491

for the record i dont blame anyone bumble or the women for choosing better profiles nobody owes me anything But i do owe it to myself to not feel down and frustrated and some days just feeling absolutely low specially when you didnt match with a profile you really really liked 

i would also like to point out that i am a special case no really ive seen peoplefriends around me getting tons and tons of matches while i get nearly none Also being from somewhere india where the ratio is heavily skewed  i think i better get out with some dignity left lol

After waiting several hours for my refresh counter to reset I literally did maybe six or seven swipes before I got locked out again and was encouraged to purchase the subscription Im going to guess this type of behavior is only indicative of a company that is starting to bleed cash and wanting to encourage its users to sign up for its services Problem is many other dating apps are not as desperate and therefore I have no desire to pay Bumble anything,0,454

"Aziz Ansari wrote Modern Romance which explains modern dating vs past generations Through this I found these useful dating app tips

1 Make it easy to start a conversation
    have something in your profile that makes it easy for your match to ask about This helps to begin engaging conversation and avoid a pointless Hey to begin

2 Do something together quickly
     one of the biggest reasons a conversation dies is from a loss of a spark If you text too much before meeting up for a first date the initial match spark dies with the conversation  You need an in person interaction to form a relationship 

3 Give it a chance
     there is a psychological tendency to want to wait for the next best thing when you believe there is an abundance of choices What this means is if we have a solid match in front of us we might want to resist committing to a date because there might be an even better match coming that we just havent seen yet Give your current match a chance Fight your tendencies go on a date and see if you genuinely like the other person

Idk if anyone else is experiencing this but I feel like my profile is completely busted When Ive gotten a prompt that I got a match I always have to reload the app to even view it and today when I got notified that I got a match and tried to view it it completely disappeared along with the only other match I had and I was allowed to start swiping again even though I ran out and it hadnt been 24 hours yet I know that this isnt out of the realm of possibility but it said she sent me a message as well so why would she unmatch with me immediately after sending a message Im just curious if this has happened to anyone else before and what should I do,0,652

I had an idea to use bumble BFF to create a discord group where it isnt as awkward as 1 on 1 talking more likely to become friends and hang out But Ive never used bumble and have very limited experience with discord lol I put the discord link in my bumble bio for my about me but Im worried it wont work Anyone seen something similar Id rather not go and ask everyone in their dms to join the discord but I also dont want this idea to fail Thank you,0,449
"Hey yea I feel like an idiot for even asking

 However I was texting with this girl for about 2 weeks and I feel like we had a lot to talk about We had no date yet because of exams but we have spoken about how we will hang out eventually after she gets her exams done and stuff
I wanted to text her again so I opened the chat with her and wanted to send her a photo of my TV with Doctor sleep playing since we were talking about it earlier today and that Ill watch it and let her know how I liked it
However after sending that photo an error popped up and Bumble asked me if I wanted to try and send it again It didnt work out however and after a while her profile was gone

So the only reason I have some doubts is that her profile didnt disappear initially but rather after trying to send her a photo multiple times and that from what Ive figured out if someone unmatches you you should still see their profile just greyed out yet I see nothing instead
So did I just get unmatched or could it be something else",0,1012

I look way better in person I promise 

These are all Ive seen just in this week It is really starting to bother me because in my opinion the person is basically calling themselves not attractive and that makes them look extremely insecure

"I get that this below isnt going to apply to folk who care enough to visit the subreddit of a dating app

Im a dude and its kinda laughable how the behavior is no different no matter what platform I use I get alot of verified only matches but its the same half assed profiles

Be a good communicator Make me laugh like okay give me something to work with besides I am human I am social Track me down in all these group pics

So far its Thursday technically Friday and I havent heard anything from him yet So Im wondering if I should send him a message or just let it go If anything I would only send something like hey hope you had a good trip and got back safely I can see hes been on the app since then so idk if it would come off as too desperate to message him if hes just ghosting me",0,783

We havent had sex because he gets a lot of anxiety and says he cant do it with someone until he feels comfortable 

We live about 15 hrs away from one another and he definitely meets me halfway There is no lack of effort on his part When we are together we dont seem to have a lot to talk about Im the one making conversation most of the time Hes a doctor so he always seems to be stressed out and kinda in a bad mood

"Seeing a lot of success stories here lately so I thought Id add my own quick one 

Ive been on OLD platforms for several years probably since Sophomore year in college and for a while I found success on Tinder casual even more on Hinge slightly more serious and finally Bumble To be perfectly honest it was hard to find a good match on Bumble versus TinderHinge and I went out on way more dates on the other platforms But my most recent match on Bumble and I decided to become official which ended the exhaustion I was facing from dating multiple girls at a time with nothing really sticking most flings last 2 weeks to 2 months Ive met dozens of girls in the past year and Im so happy to be in a relationship in which we both want to be with each other exclusively

I think Bumble has really progressive values and I think the space it has created is certainly the direction we are headed in the future Even though my date opened up the conversation with a hi  an emoji I felt pressure taken off of me to always be initiating the conversation In my experience a guy who tries to go titfortat in initiationeffort is going to have a hard time but Bumble definitely evens out the playing field and makes it more comfortable for both parties

BTW I did pay for Bumble Premium A lot of people here complain that those quick matches dry up after their first couple weeks of signing up or after buying Premium Bumble is not meant to be a place for quick matches Every time I used the boost feature I got anywhere between 13 solid choices which to me is enough can you really maintain 20 conversations I cant At one point I was managing 6 different conversations some beyond the app which was super stressful I still have a couple weeks remaining on my plan so now I use it for Bizz

I most recently matched with a girl who stood out immediately from the others She really was exactly what I am looking for She very quickly sent out a Do not Disturb gif as her first message Slightly confused I shot back with a funnywitty response which she also responded to fairly quickly positively and with a question I then came back and then silence I waited 36H shot her another funny message and 36H laternothing Im usually pretty confident guy but I admit this one is tossing me for one my own fault of course But does anybody have any advise insight I know I am not going to be liked by everyone I guess Im just confused about the opening do not disturb Much appreciates folks Happy swiping",0,1190

"Hey everybody Im facing a sociological glitch in my online dating life that I cant seem to figure out but it seems like an interesting problem worth figuring out Disclaimer  Im in India so there may be some cultural differences but having traveled in Europe and the US a fair bit I think urban life and dating is fairly similar

Ive been on hinge about 6 months and Ive had GREAT success Ive connected and chatted with some amazing women  some of them have become really good friends and there has been enough romance to make me pretty happy I havent been able to meet too many because I actually live 8 hours away from New Delhi in a village and well covid 

My match rate on Hinge is really good at least for a newly single 40 year old I think of all my rightswipes 25 percent respond very positively Of course I see a SIGNIFICANT drop in matches when I generically hit like instead of sending a nice genuine message but I still get matches 

None of them have turned into anything romantically long term but thats on me and not the app I have made great lifelong friends though  

For info  the Hinge match rating barely changes if I pay for hinge or not I just pay for it because I like access to certain filters like I know its never going to work out with me and a nonsmoker 

Having had this great ego boosting success on hinge and running out of potential matches I downloaded hinge and paid for it 

Its been 3 months now  I have had 4 matches Two of them I had brief conversations with 2 I just waited for them to say something until they timed out 

I tried changing strategies  lowered my swipeleft rate rewrote my profile a couple of times changed picture but no bueno 

I could just stop paying for Bumble and my live wouldnt change a bit But Im just paying to try to understand why this is Is it a technology UI factor or is it that putting the onus on women significantly changes the dynamic Or is it the difference in profiles 

I would LOVE a womans perspective on this to help get to the bottom of this mystery 

Here are both my profiles  because obviously this is just stabbing in the dark without looking at them

"I have been using the same couple dating apps since I have been single Bumble I always thought was supposed to be a little cooler or maybe more reliable since the girl had to message you Either way I found the prettier girls on here compared to either hinge or tindr

I have actually had zero success with this app so far I actually had maybe 3 matches since March and my profile looks normal and my pics are pretty decent and not too flashy

Im a 510 dude who spends a lot of time at the gym and I couldnt be happier with the way I look as well as my life in general I also spend a lot of time outside and always staying active and tan haha

I grew up talking to people my whole life so talking to strangers is something I do often either for fun or honestly for the hell of it 

Now when Im either out in public or at the gym I have no problem going up to random girls and starting a conversation I always seem to think of something clever to stat a conversation I never plan to say anything it just kind of happens

I feel like its nearly impossible  to show my energypersonality through online dating and clearly whoever is reading my texts are just going to decipher them in their own words so what I say and how I actually would say it are completely different

Also maybe its just God telling me to stop but the last two girls I took out on dates made it clear they have problems either emotional or just not happy seems to be a big one and I can tell they have not really found their way and these girls were 28 and 29   
Thats a big turn off for me because even being single Im really happy with my life and what I do and just kind of waiting to share my life with someone else 

I know using the app or apps increases your chances by probability but Im starting to think the probability is lower and decreasing more and more by the day haha",0,1850

We were supposed to meet up on Saturday night but I cancelled four days out I felt like I wanted to do this for a while but didnt have the guts to I really hope she finds someone swell She deserves it It just wasnt mean to be me 

I thought I would share this because often men and women think there is something wrong with them when someone flakes out or doesnt want to follow up on the first date This isnt always the case Sometimes the other person is just in a weird place that they wouldnt have seen coming if not for going on dates That seems cruel I guess",0,1256

Her bio showed she was from an Eastern European city and that she and her sister operate a startup in the city Earlier this morning I was sort of mindlessly swiping left and right and came across a girl who I thought was a bit out of my league but thought Why not Again to my surprise we matched Her bio also referenced a startup and wouldnt you know it shes from the same city

I matched with this girl on bumble and almost immediately after we matched she asked if we could move over to Snapchat I agreed Ive done that before because some people prefer certain apps to others for communication 

Well we find each other on Snapchat and almost immediately this girl asks me for sordid images of myself I did not send them but she kept insisting 

She also told me that she couldnt find me on Instagram I told her I didnt have one 

I never sent her what she wanted I started getting nervous that she might be an extortionist or a blackmailer Keep in mind here she knew my first and last name but I still didnt even know hers at this point and she was asking me for all these compromising images 

Well I ask her what her last name is and she gives me a name I started googling her to try and confirm who she said she was Ive had girls google me before and I didnt mind not to mention she had already tried finding me on other platforms 

Well I find out she is real and also that she didnt give me her last name as I asked but her middle name I tell her I did this basic background check on her and she gets really upset saying it was the creepiest thing that ever happened to her and how I shouldnt have done that and how I need to be more trusting of people on dating sites 

I unfriended her not long after that as things had broken down Was I in the wrong for looking into her I dont think she has the right to be so upset at me for doing a basic google search into the stranger on the internet asking for sordid images of me Everything I looked up was public information but she wanted images of me that no one else in the world has and could do serious damage to me if the world did see them",0,1806
"Last May I matched with a guy on Bumble After matching we decided to move to texting because neither of us liked the chat feature of Bumble 

Were not friends on social media but he gave me his number I looked up his number and found his first and last name and stalked his socials before meeting up with him for the first time I do this all the time so I know the persons not a catfish Looked pretty okaydecent so I went about seeing him 

I went on a couple of dates with him last May and enjoyed his company and liked him as a person We made out a bit in our second date fully clothed 

Take note that we didnt exchange social media in the couple of times we met up 

Yesterday I looked at his Facebook again and couldnt find him for some reason I logged on to my second profile and looked for him there  lo and behold hed Facebookstalked me as well and blocked my main account 

The reason Hed posted a pic with his arm around a girl wearing an engagement ring just last Sunday 

Take note that when Id first gone through his social media prior to meeting him there was ZERO trace of him having a fiancee or even a girlfriend He looked single AF 

He hasnt reached out via text since blocking me and I have no desire to message him again 

Not sure if hes just a lying cheating sack of shit or if this was an ex hed gotten back together with  but Im not holding my breath for an explanation 

And just when I thought I had finally matched with someone decent Ugh",0,1466
"If you have kids I think its weird to be showing them if they are minors on a platform mainly meant for building romantic connections Like nothing against people who have kids but you can easily put that in your profile without showing their faces 

If theyre your niecesnephewsyounger siblingsfriends kids thats even worse Now youre putting someone elses kid online for dozens and dozens of random strangers to see them Most parents usually post their own children on private social media or on social media that they only have close friends and family on I doubt theyd want their child being seen by a bunch of strangers And there could be so many creeps on Bumble 

Baby photos of yourself is a bit odd to me too Im just not exactly sure what people expect to gain from that Like if Im looking through a guys profile a baby photo isnt going to make me inclined to swipe right Like okay you were a cute baby but you were also a baby I dont feel any attraction to infants and children so Im just not sure how to feel about that I think thats more of something to post on Facebook not your dating profile But I digress",0,1118
So on this guys profile it always gives the city name but the distance appears and disappears very often couple of times a day so is it just appearing when hes on the app and when he closes it the distance disappears Also does the distance change automatically when he connects to different WiFis Or does he actually have to be actively using the app for the distance to change,0,377
"Im 28F and Im moderately active Im in decently good shape I do either a relaxed yoga flow or a short high intensity workout everyday I enjoy leisurely hikes and bike rides on easy trails relaxed swimming fun kayaking I love being outdoors painting stargazing practising my photography and glamping Anything thats very comfortable and nonstrenuous basically

But beyond that I dont do much Ive never learnt horse riding surfing  tennis or skiing etc I dont play or watch team sports Im also not into intense challenging hiking biking trips I have other hobbies I love and commit to art cooking music travel but sports isnt one of them

For some reason all the men I end up on dates with are VERY athletic and adventurous I do find this attractive and I would be happy for them to continue these hobbies on their own time if we get serious But I feel insecure that they would probably prefer an equally adventurous woman Men who consider yourself very sporty and adventurous  how much of a turn off would this be How important is it that a woman matches your activity levels",0,1072

1 I have a personal rule that I just dont hit on people while they work its weird i guess idk how to explain it and theyre just trying to do their job

Ladies of bumble what happens when you match with someone and never message  Im way more curious than angry but it happens all the time  Constantly even  I have a suspicion that some people dont look past the first picture  and only actually look after a match is made which i suppose would save time,0,300

40F back on Bumble after about a year of pandemicrelated hiatus and Im somewhat flabbergasted at how 80 of the male profiles I see age range 3545 are just looking for something casual or are blank I dont remember it being like this beforeis this possibly a pandemic hangover just got out of 3rd lockdown in my area Sort of people not expecting much due to the limitations on meeting up Or has Tinder done something to piss a ton of people off and they are just dispersing to other apps,0,485

"I was on a streak of like 10 matches about 1 every two weeks all of whom didnt say a single word to me and just let the match expire I was feeling like why tf am I still on here I cant even have a conversation with someone

Then last week I get another match and to my surprise they actually say hi I was feeling somewhat elated that I would finally get to talk to someone We chat a small amount and then she just ghosts me for no apparent reason

Now idk if theres something wrong with me that this affects me so much but I felt really gutted After months of nothingness swiping through pictures like a buffoon Finally finding someone to talk to and then it just ends like that after 5 messages Really makes me feel worthless 

So I start thinking I should delete the app because its causing my to feel horrible But then I realize that I have no alternatives and deleting the app will only make my chance to find someone even smaller So I keep using it 

I want to know why most matches dont say anything Are they just busy Should I use the extend time button I never do that because I feel like it would come across as desperate but maybe thats just my insecurities speaking",0,1176

One guy told me he wants something serious and we met at for a 15 minutes talk on the street and then after I got back home he messaged me frequently and later asked me go to his place the next day 

With that said never again no more cheap date Cheap date reflects a lot about the guys intention",0,538
"Many times I cut a match lose for various reasons The main one being lack of effort in replies For example one word replies 8 hours wait times for a response consistently not asking questions or simply not responding the list could go on I think a comment box for the person could be useful

Some constructive criticism in feedback form would go a long way in helping people self reflect and potentially improve their approach with future matches",0,571

"I never realized that you could request swipe data from Bumble until I saw a post about a month ago Below is my data which took about 10 days to get As reference I am a 41F who lives about 30 minutes outside a major city New York City I am 58 135lb and of Asian descent The data collected below is for the 5 months Ive been on Bumble since January of 2021 My search criteria is pretty simple Its  5 of my age and 20 miles of my location

For the generalization that women having an easier experience online out of the 180 matches Ive had only 5 active convos remain  I think the golden rules of online dating apply to both genders  Be attractive and Dont be unattractive I also think that age and race play a role too Just food for thought Its certainly not for the faint hearted out there

We met on the Bumble in August 2020 and went out a couple of times each date was amazing Staying up until the early morning talking and laughing She decided though that since my kids were younger 13 amp 10 I have them every other week hers are grown and gone that it wasnt going to work out I told her I understood and said I hoped to stay friends

We stay in contact and then one night were up late again texting We go out a couple of more times amazing dates again and then her life gets upended just a ton of personal crap hits her I try to be there for her and supportive but she pulls away so I back off and tell her Ill give her space

I get into a relationship over the winter thats nothing serious more of a time killer than anything I decide one day to just check in and see how life is going We fall back into our same routine of long text conversations and a couple of phone calls Shes had a long week and I tell her Im going to take her out for a day of fun she doesnt have to make any decisions just be ready when I show up I plan out an entire day and it just goes amazing

Since then if its a week that I dont have my kids we are inseparable and then the weeks I do have my kids we are in contact and find time to see each other She has reconciled my family situation is supportive of me being the best father I can and is willing to integrate with my life We have both said multiple times that its the happiest weve ever been

Just thought Id post this to give everyone some hope Theres so many bad connections out there and Ive had my share but if you are patient lightning can strike and you realize what has been missing in your life Looking back when we met even though we had intense chemistry neither of us was ready or capable at the time to be in a serious relationship However patience and persistence pays off if you feel that deep connection with someone there may be some obstacles but if you both communicate openly and honestly it can work out

One last thing shes 51 and Im 48 I realize most on here are younger but no matter the age there is someone out there for all of us someone that makes you wake up every morning ready to take on the day someone that is there to build you up when you need it share in the good times and the bad Dont settle for less",0,2410

"So Im libertarian  For those of you who dont know its like a conservative and a liberal had a kid who ignored the restrictions both sides would impose  

Liberals want tons of social freedom legalizing marijuana keeping abortions legal some want to lower the drinking age gay marriage rights etc but they want relatively few financial freedoms having high taxes and allowing the government to use the money as they see fit  

Conservatives are the opposite wanting relatively few social freedoms gun rights being the exception but tons of economic freedom basically few government programs and consequently very low taxes  

Libertarians want society to have as many social and economic freedoms as possible without it becoming total chaos  The saying is My right to swing my fist ends at your face  For example a libertarian would say you may drive as fast as youd like as long as youre driving on an empty road and maybe dont have anyone dependent on you  They want the smallest government possible without society going down the drain a government that only does what the people cannot or will not do  

So Im not purely a liberal or a conservative because I dont agree with the restrictions that either side would impose  Im not a moderate because libertarianism is a pretty extreme viewpoint  Im certainly not apolitical either  Which option I should use  Or should I just leave it blank if I dont actually fit into one  Right now Im using moderate because it shows I care about politics but do not fit into conventional categories",0,1536

"Why is there such a large discrepancy between the web and phone version of bumble

For instance I have Bumble Premium there is no undo button on the web version Like come on Bumble I paid for that feature there is no reason why I shouldnt have access to that feature just because I am using my web browser 

Another example is filters we dont have the same filter options for whatever reason like why is there no hard Deal Breaker toggle on in web version

Also just a general suggestion in filters give us the option to see no preference  left blank This is useful for those of us who arent looking for a particular hard answer for something

Like for instance I am unsure whether I want kids or not so I left it blank in my profile I would love to see all the other people who left that question blank also because it scares me when a profile says wants kids or says doesnt want kids

Or for instance I am politically a right leaning moderate so I want to go see moderates apolitical and people who didnt answer the question first in my queue then followed by conservatives then lastly liberals Makes it hard to find a lot of apolitical  moderate people who chose to not fill out the question as an indicator that they dont care about politics

Lastly I dont get why Bumble like all other dating service doesnt have an exclude aka not boolean filter where you are okay with everything else but one or two groups For instance if we wanted see everyone but one political group we want to see everyone but one religion group etc it saves us time by letting us checkmark one thing only in the filter instead of having to checkmark a bunch of filters every time and it indirectly lets us see people who leave certain questions blank on their profile",0,1746

Im stuck between two thoughts and one is way worse than the other 

Either something is wrong with my account hopefully or trying to date when you hit 30 is MUUUUCH much harder than it should be 


Anyone else experienced this Should I be scared",0,579
"Finally Im happy with my bio and photos and created a profile

I though Bumble was a dating app a bit more serious there are questions and prompts to fill

But nope 90 of woman have no prompt and an emptyone line bio The ones that have a bio its just a bunch of negativity

I feel a bit silly Ive filled everything Worried that maybe woman think I talk too much haha

So last Friday was my first date with her It went well and we have been talking ever since with tentative plans to go out again We texted good morning every day since and for those of you thinking she was just being nice I even asked post first date if I could call her sometime and she said call me anytime Now Im still talking to other girls on there and still setting up dates so Im always looking to improve my profile I also have no expectations of her to stop talking to people after one date either as thats just rediculous  Yesterday I changed my main profile pic FF to today and I see that she unmatched with my on Bumble When I saw this I sent her a text message just simply asking how her day was and although I expected no response but she did respond saying she had an Ok day What is going on here I kind of understand why someone would un match once you are testing because you are always able to see peoples location on the app which is weird But is that why she unmatched I feel like it has more to do with her seeing me updating my profile and thinking Im not into her What do you guys think Should i even bother asking her or just let it kind of fizzle out,0,1174
"Hi I will keep this short I am trying to replace one of my 5 interests on my profile It will let me remove one but once I select another it will disappear off of my profile after I save it 

I have updated the Bumble app and tried rebooting my phone but even now it is only showing the 45 interests I selected instead of all 5 

This isnt too big of a deal for me I was just curious to see if anybody else has experienced this or knows a potential fix

"Listen I know yall dont have an ideal option for how to list yourselves and I assume youre all going through the same thought process of well girls do better on dating sites anyway may as well list it as a womans profile and explain it in the bio

WOMEN DO BETTER WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THEM STRAIGHT COUPLES TROJANING AS A WOMANS PROFILE ARE A NUISANCE IN THIS COMMUNITY

If you are serious about your search be honest with yourself about the ACTUAL number of people who are interested in the VERY SPECIFIC THING youre asking for and list yourself under the mans name with his pictures Same song and dance from there

People who are primarily attracted to women are more likely to be exclusively attracted to women and bumble is without a doubt the BEST dating app for us If youre looking to set up a threesome or hook up with other couples there is also a best dating app for you its called okcupid But if you insist on using bumble please be considerate and respectful When you fill your profile with pics of just a woman and use her name and the fact that youre a couple is simply listed as an afterthought only including an actual picture of the man at the very bottom IF that its manipulative There is no point in trying to game the system when your end goal is to meet real human beings in real life and have consensual sex Be honest about who you are and what you want

Straight women are WAY more open to experimenting with other women than lesbians are to experimenting with men You will likely find more success in that arena unless your boyfriend is ugly and if thats the case then you must live with your choices But as a woman whose sexuality is fluid and has mutually exclusive gay modes and straight modes i have seen both sides and i can promise you that while a straight woman can curate a deck of just men gay women never ever have the luxury of doing the same no matter how many buttons and levers we push thanks to straight women thinking they get a 1

Errr yeah not so much The novelty of being able to see 50 people in the beeline was cool though most of them were way outside my distance range But what I really noticed is that my stack and subsequent matches came to a screeching halt I flip through it every couple of days and usually have around 20 or 30 guys per day Ill swipe right on a handful and typically match with a couple So in any given week Ill swipe through 100 men match with maybe 10 chat with a few make plans with one or two That sort of thing

"Over Thinking Bumble

Imagine a race with 100 people where youre one of the competitors Are you the fastest smartest best looking most athletic most talented gifted etc enough to beat all other 99 competitors to the finish line What if we expand the number of competitors to 1000 10000 100000 or more What are the odds that you are the best and beat your peers to reach the finish line Sadly this is 90 of the people on OnLine Dating OLD and few realise how difficult they are making things for themselves by being generic and swimming with the rest of the fish

Instead imagine a situation where youre one of only 10 people in your race or less Only ten people to beat what are your chances of being victorious then What if I told you that the top 3 or more leaders get selected How much better do you think youll do if youre only competing against 10 people or even less What if youre the only person running the race and the other people in your division havent turned up to start racing yet

Why should you put more info in your profile Imagine youre checking applications for a job people hand in resumes where they havent even bothered to fill out the paperwork some of them half filled some have actually done the work and made a point to fill it out correctly who are you going to ignore and who are you going to check Additionally every little piece of info you give further distinguishes yourself from the crowd

The danger of many profiles Ive seen Im not expert just observant is most are generic to the point they do nothing to distinguish themselves from everyone else and thus forced to compete against everyone else However once in a while there are people who I would argue are smart and set themselves apart in such a way they become leaders in their niche Theres a saying find your niche become rich or niches get bitches

As part of my experiment I decided to borrow my lady friends profile and generically sample 100 mens profiles through Bumbles swipe list with NO SEARCH FILTERS I recorded some of their basic details and decided to see where the weight of 100 individuals laid their details

Mens Breakdown

Initial Photos

54 Verified their profiles proving that their photos are in fact their photos which is nice when you want to make sure that the person is in fact the person in their photo and youre not being catfished

43 uploaded 3 images or less 67 uploaded 3 images or more showing off their lifestyles their looks and increasing their chances of convincing people theyre actually who they say they are

Information on profiles

So if your photos are good enough you might get someone to stop on your profile but is there actually enough here to actually convince people that youre interesting A match Fun to be around or able to hold an interesting conversation To earn a none the person hasnt bothered to type a single letter in their profile to earn a limited they filled in either their bio or a question to earn a full I watched for people who filled in 2 sections bioprompts in any combination or more 27 couldnt be arsed to type a single letter 33 filled in their bio or answered one prompt 40 actually filled a bio and a prompt or more

For reference I right swiped the BEST profiles people who have good photos filled out bios provided interesting answers and convinced me they would be fun to hang around out of the 100 profiles only 5 made it this far the good profiles REALLY STOOD OUT it was like seeing a sportscar car amongst all the beaten up trash vehicles

Random bits of info

30 mentioned they had a dog or had a dog photo only 5 said they liked cats or had a cat photo

The majority of star signs was surprisingly even disproving my original confirmation bias that Aquarius and Scorpios dominated Capricorns Geminis Leos Taurus each had an 8 slice Aries Aquarius Virgos made up 7 each Libra Pieces Scorpios were 6 each Cancer and Sagittarius were only 5 of the majority 17 of men didnt bother to include their star signs in their profile

9 of men included their Instagram showing off their pretty cool lives or work

13 added their Spotify to show off their musical taste

What does this mean at the end of the day

Unfortunately I dont have data to necessarily confirm or deny that the people who filled out more or less info got more matches Basic logic tells me people who are THAT good looking who dont need the additional help are far in between instead the rest of us need to use every advantage we need

Like I said unless youre so goddamn good looking that you dont need the help you should really distinguish yourself if you compete with the rest youll die with the rest",0,4636

"Just now giving bumble another try but I kinda dipped out on it a couple months back because I wasnt paying quite enough attention to profiles and had swiped on somebody I thought was more or less perfect in every respect and we matched

However whenever I match I like to just double check the persons profile occasionally I miss things or they change something in between matching and me finally getting around to viewing it and I noticed upon my double checking that Id somehow missed where they specified that they were only interested in poly relationships which doesnt work for me nothing against them its just not something I personally could be happy with

Im trying to make more friends and we really did have more or less everything else in common and I also hate when absolutely nothing happens from a match I know I know its part of OLD and it happens but it still annoys me so I sent them a message explaining basically everything above apologizing for having missed the info and that we unfortunately wouldnt have been compatible but that I still wanted to be friends I unfortunately dont have the message I sent to post here I got a notification that they replied but by the time I got a chance to check the reply they had unmatched They were not the same gender as me so no chance of finding them on BFF either side note I cant believe BFF is still like that after all this time

Ok that was in the past and after awhile that seemed to go away after app updates Now recently there is a different error with the super like where the money goes through but the app doesnt recognize I already bought it So when I try to super like the person it automatically goes back to the pay screen a second time

But I checked my email and account and the money did in fact go through of course since that is bumbles top priority apparently and not designing a well coded app

I sent them an email asking for a refund and never got a reply I was lucky enough to see how to get a refund from the play store and it worked since I used my Google Wallet

If I bought it with my bank account I would still be relying on these people who probably dont even check the emails for a refund that Im not sure I would even get",0,973

 Ive been on bumble for at least year bare minimum
 Ive literally gotten one match and a conversation that died quickly
 Ive tried different pics of myself both selfish and professional
 Ive tried no descriptions vague descriptions in depth descriptions The heart of the description has always stayed true to who I am
 Ive tried being selective with likes Ive been liberal with likes
 Ive tried looking for casual Ive tried only looking for a relationship Ive tried being open for either
 each change I use for at least a month not changing my profile constantly 

I know Im not ugly and I know Im not Idris elba or Dwayne Johnson or anything but it seems odd to me that Ive never gotten more than one match in 1 possible 2 years

I know in real life the women who even remotely seem interested tend to want or have kids already but its hard for me to believe that desired childlessness is that big of a turn off to women of all sorts

And I know that Im not trying to do anything long distance but its not like I live in the middle of nowhere

Im trying to think of alternatives to explain this lack of interest aside from the typical girls dont match or message first Because I have similar experiences on other sitesapps as well The only difference on the other apps is that there have been more noticeable fake profiles and scammers

Before I start trying to find a platonic female friend to run my profile by

Met this girl off bumble who happened to be a friend of a friend as well I was interested cuz she was pretty was the same race as mewhich is rare where I live and enjoyed things that I also enjoyed like raves

Set up the date and met up with her Akward first hug but hey thats okay well warm up with each other at some point  WRONG We meet at Starbucks so I get her a drink she doesnt even thank me for it whatever we go sit outside I was in for a treat

The next two hours she talks about herself and only herself How she got fucked up at this rave last week and hooked up with the dudes and kept saying how hot they were I just smiled and nodded thinking when tf can I go home

When she would pause to catch her breathe I would interject something relating to what she was talking about but she quickly hushed me as she had an amazing story to finish After 30 min of hearing her rave mdma hookup story I thought maybe its time to talk about each other NOPE Time to talk about how she made a Harry Potter inspired alcoholic drink for her friends

I swear to god she didnt ask me a single question the WHOLE time we talked After two hours we walked to the trash can to throw away our drinks and she quickly walks to her car I tell her it was nice talking to her and maybe Ill see her at the next rave cuz we both had tickets to it I dont know if I did anything wrong here it was a very weird vibe and Ive never had a date go that bad before Just had to rant now Im tired and have work in the morning rip",0,1504

I guess I vacillate between wanting to preserve Active for body builderstrainersextended length backpackersmarathonerstriathletes essentially people who are actively training and would consider themselves athletes VS seeing the active level as for people who workout consistently but arent as intensely focused on physical goals

Sometimes feels strange especially when never is the only other option Like if you do more than nothing youre in the sometimes category

How do you guys personally define the categories for yourself

I do 20 mins1hr of yoga every day and have previously dabbled in hiit weight lifting and running programs Ive never gotten to the point where I would consider myself close to an expertadvanced level but Ive been able to extend myself and accomplish certain things I wouldnt have been able to do otherwise For example Ive gotten to the point with past programs where I can consistently be able to do sets of 8 pushups or running 3 10 minute miles as a female Neither of those things is in athlete territory but it required from me months of putting in the effort to get there

"Ive just had a bit of a surreal date and just thought Id give you guys a bit of a funny story and maybe get your thoughts

Im in my mid 20s and have had a bf before but we met at work and never really like dated It just kind of happened We broke up over lockdown Im still devastated but need to try to move on so downloaded bumble 

I matched with a guy and weve had a pretty banterous back and forth while getting to know eachother over the past few weeks You know both making fun of eachother and not taking ourselves too seriously Its been a lot of fun and we have a lot in common So we agreed to meet How bad can it be

So we meet up We then go into the restaurant and he says something that really really cut deep actually He says you look uglier in real life I asked him to repeat it kind of thinking I must have misheard and he does I was just kind of taken aback

I was half tempted to leave but stuck through the meal He made fun of quite a few things my shoes the school I went to my backpack etc but there was nothing really complimentary Like I dont think he said a single thing that was nice 

I kind of figured he was trying to be funny but wasnt into me so made a quick getaway after the meal He walks me to the train station and kisses my cheek on the way On the way I could feel him maybe going to grab my hand but wasnt sure so put them in my pockets I then go in for the goodbye hug and he TRIES TO KISS ME ON THE LIPS as I pulled back from the hug I just swerved him very awkward as very public and was like Ooh haha maybe not on the first date

He then texts asking me how I found it I did not mince my words and said it was like an hour and a half of a roasting session and couldnt believe the comments on my looks He apologises calls me twice says he really likes me thinks Im cute and thinks Im too good for him and he was trying to be funny He wants me to forgive him and see him again so he can redeem himself

Am I just really really unlucky or is this how dating is I think maybe he was nervous and was trying to be funny But maybe this is a huge red flag 

It just really cut to the core when he said about my looks and now I feel really selfconscious I dont have any filtered photos or anything and Ive just tried to show me as I am I actually think I could take some better photos if I could really be bothered Now Im worried about future dates ",0,2376

3 I click the check to approve and most of the time nothing happens

But often time I do get a match click to enter the app see the profile and think About time This woman actually shares all of my specific interests same drive goals no kids etc And to be blunt has a similar attraction level to my previous relationships 

But every time I get that last option nothing happens when I click the check It just moves to the next profile

The guy was homosexual I am straight  I have no issues with gayslesbians etc and dont really care about sexualities but there is a reason why I am mentioning this

We go out to this dark bar I meet up with his 2 friends They were in their 30s chill dudes

We go on and the guy who invited me offers to get us all beers He goes to the bar and comes back with 4 open beer bottles I didnt think any of it and we said cheers and started drinking and talking

2 sips into the beer I noticed I was getting a little dizzy not like the regular feeling when you are drunk It was more like I didnt have too much power and my head was heavy I then look around and see nobody is drinking from their drinks its only me who sips

I didnt think much of it and continue to talk to them when and drink from the beer In about 5 minutes I noticed that still nobody was drinking and I was getting tipsy from 10 sips I can usually drink about 150ml of straight whiskey until I get to the point of being a little drunk

Fast forward to half a bottle down this guy starts joking how one time he spiked the drink of a girl while I am drinking from mine I dont know what it was but right when he said that my head was so heavy to the point where I could barely stand I stood up and felt like I swallowed a golf ball in my throat 

I told them that I had to make a call outside and proceeded to put my jacket on while doing so I started seeing the people around me as silhouettes and everything was moving like I was about to fall on the floor I quickly went out the bar and started walking home while walking though I continued to see silhouettes of the people that were passing around me then I realised I was walking into the completely wrong direction so I panicky turned away and continued walking This feeling continued for the next 30 minutes and faded away

So let this girl a while back on a dating app went on a date with her and didnt really go well because I did not know that place only took cash 4 years later her and I are okay acquaintances We talk on occasion about music and politics One day we were talking and she kind of let it slip that her boyfriend broke up a while back ago So me wanting to make up for My mess up basically start talking to her seeing if she might be interested in going on a date she said she is and so by start to try to figure out a time to do that We set up dates and then she cancels This happens multiple times She says she has to study or shes too busy One We plan three weeks ahead to go out to the really nice bar and restaurant that I know She said she is completely in she has her schedule cleared And then again she cancels saying that shes too stressed out and there were too many things going on and she just wanted a day to herself to relax and study So now Im realizing shes just needing me along or trying not to make me feel bad So I tell her its fine we can just be friends dont got to keep the jig up She says its totally fine if we be friends but still like to hang out But doesnt ever message me And then post picture of herself on Instagram saying sorry I cant hang out today I got to study then shows herself sarcastically laying in bed eating snacks and sleeping Am I being too sensitive here or was that kind of a dick move by her,0,1432

 have you had some meaningful contacts come out of it that have led properly to work mentorship advice etc

 did you find any Bizz matches on there who actually had ulterior motives towards dating you when its not what you were there for This is my main reservation against using the function incidentally  worried about sleaze or at least mismatched expectations creeping in if I wanted to date the person Id swipe right on the correct damn function

"Hi everyone 

So yesterday Ive been on a first date with a guy I had matched with on Bumble we had been texting for about 10 days 

I 28 F was the one who suggested that we go on a date in the first place and he seemed enthusiastic about the idea I think the date went really well Definitely the best one I had in a while and I felt like he liked it too At the end of the date the goodbye was a bit awkward which I think its quite normal sometimes and he ended up hugging me 

Its been 24hrs and I havent heard anything from him Normally I wouldnt mind being the first one to text but this time around I felt like Ive done a lot of first moves with him and Id like to give him the chance of showing that hes interested as well In nearly all the dates Ive been on so far the guy would text me at least the standard thank you message the same evening  and thats what I thought was the norm Should I take the fact that he hasnt texted me anything as a sign that he is not interested  How much do you wait before texting someone after a date

I feel like Im overthinking this but I just really liked the guy

Thanks",0,1111

I dated my ex boyfriend D from April of 2019  October of 2020  Then I met my new boyfriend T on bumble this February  The other day T and I were reminiscing and we wanted to see our old chats so I redownloaded bumble and had to guess my log in information  I did accurately guess my log in for bumble but I guess correctly for an OLD account I forgot I had  It was an account I made for Bumble BFF back in 2018 when I first moved to a new state  I had matched with a total of 6 girls and ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE GIRLS MY EX D WOULD EVENTUALLY CHEAT ON ME WITH it was also his ex girlfriend  My brain cannot fathom the odds of this  Out of the millions and millions of people in the area I matched with her  It was shocking  That bumble match I sent like 2 messages back and forth to would one day destroy my relationship and call me a crazy stupid bitch and I didnt even realize we had encountered one another before ,0,920
"TLDR None of the options in Looking for accurately fit my dating mind set and Im wondering how others deal with that particular system

As I think about the options available in the looking for section dont know yet something casual relationship marriage I realize none of them will accurately express my dating intentions Combine with the perception that dont know yet and something casual are mostly regarded as code for FWB or hooking up I feel like any option I choose going to do me a disservice

To provide some background into why I feel this way I do not believe in marriage and I approach life with a have no expectations and I wont be disappointed mindset With that in mind I would ideally want to date someone for 36 months  nonexclusively so I can make sure I want to pursue a serious relationship with said person However I am quickly learning that this goes against most societal norms I see most people want to establish exclusivity within a couple of months some within a month Thats scary to me since exclusivity is basically my equivalent of marriage I need a longer nonexclusive period to protect myself and my interests Which is why the options frustrate me a lot

 Relationship

This may seem like the obvious choice given the above information but it goes against my have no expectations mantra Stating I want a relationship in my profile only to match with someone and explain I want to date nonexclusively for 36 months makes me very anxious I feel like Im scamming the other person 

I also think using the relationship descriptor is counter productive My immediate goal when meeting someone and starting the dating process is to enjoy spending time with that person as much as possibe The best way I can ensure that is by staying as present as I possibly can and basically date them with a complete disregard for the future of the relationship They and I will enjoy today and we will think about tomorrow tomorrow In short I wish there was a descriptor to signal those that date with a similar mindset to my own

 Something casual

Best case scenario I will match with others who only want to hook up or do a friends with benefits which I dont want Worst case it basically tells others to stay away from me and I already barely get matches and swipes 

 Dont know yet

This is what I feel is the best description of me but if others are going to treat it like I want just sex but Im too scared to be upfront about it I end up in the same purgatory as something casual

 Marriage

Thankfully I can simply eliminate this I dont believe in marriage so I dont use this descriptor I also filter out anyone who has this in their profile

Does anyone else feel similar If you were in my shoes how would you approach the problem",0,2746

"TLDR Tell me why Im doing her a favor by keeping things short and succinct and not being an open book right away

I have this idealized idea of just being me and giving full thoughtful responses That the right person will appreciate that and not see it as a sort of desperation or overshare In the real world when I meet somebody new I treat them like an old friend I give them my full personality spectrum

So typically the lady will have a few lines with a few questions She answers my questions minimally While I have a wall of text painting a picture of whatever Im explaining I do in a way think I am trying to prove Im interesting and worthwhile which after the COVID dry spell I suppose Im a little latching on to what comes my way like its scarce

I suck at texting and usually try to get a phone call after a couple exchanges On a call fleshed out conversation and stories become appreciated and it speaks to a personality

I need to write something and post it on my bathroom mirror
BEFORE YOU RESPOND
Shorter responses  Youre busy but can find some time to respond
Surplus mindset  This isnt the only person youre talking to and there are plenty of people out there
Youre valuable  Give her the chance to earn your attention people appreciate things they earn

"So I have my account which is currently Snoozed because Im not aiming to date just yet somehow in the few minutes I had it up and I got a few matches and they all messaged me Despite these seemingly good indicators Im still improving my account but getting bored because improvements are small and difficult to gauge without feedback While talking to one of the women who matched me I asked her why she matched my profile and she shared it was because most of the profiles out there dont have any effortinformationphotosshared interests

If its not obvious theres a lot of competition out there so what are some people doing thats successful and what are some doing thats killing their opportunities My suggestion browse your competition and think to yourself would I swipe on this profile

I wont go into how to create an account because its not rocket science if you can create a Bumble account you can create a temporary one Alternatively borrow your friend of the opposite sexs phone to browse let them use your account so they can see what its like on the opposite side The two of you can exchange notes afterwards about what youve learnt

First lets address the ethical boundaries If you never match with anyone and never start conversations with them then nobodys expectations are being hurt especially if your profile has no info this is basically 90 of the interaction most people have on Bumble anyway Second youre only using this profile to browse nothing more do you feel guilty for looking through Ebay or any online shop because you shouldnt

ampx200B

What are you looking at and for

1 Swipe through accounts and think to yourself 
   1 What is my first impression
   2 What messages do their photos send
   3 Why is this person interesting Or why ISNT this person interesting
   4 Would I want to date this person as the opposite sex
   5 HOW has their profile helped you come up with your answers
   6 What have you learnt from this profile that you can apply to your own
2 Delete your account when done

Hopefully by doing this little bit of research youll understand where you and your profile stands In my case I didnt feel so bad about my height or my chances but I also occasionally saw some sex bomb accounts people who obviously know what theyre doing amazing photos fascinating prompts These accounts definitely inspired me to do better

For men DO BETTER the minimal effort  minimal replies For women its really all about your photos dont scare men away with red flags in your prompts too",0,2515

And I know many women who feel the same  or just dont even consider height a factor at all

Ive been talking to a girl I met on the app and in my profile it says have kids  want more Weve met up once and were constantly chatting everyday with a plan to meet up again this week

However the topic of my child hasnt come up yet we only met for 1hr and a half and Im more inclined to talk about my situation in person for context im a part time dad as my kid lives with the mother so not really comfortable texting about it

Im having a bit of anxiety over whether or not shes read my small info bit and knows I have kids and is just too polite to bring it up Now the pressure of it has built to a point where Im worried shell bail as soon as she knows I have a kid or make a scene if it does happen then so be it as Ive had a bad experience with it a few months ago

Has anyone been in a situation where the person they are dating hasnt read your bio in full Or any situation where youve got kidstheyve got kids and the topic hasnt come up and you struggle to insert it into the conversation Whats the general etiquette of telling someone youre dating about your children

"I wouldnt say Im the most attractive guy I havent been on a date in over 10 years However I spent alot of time on wellness therapy and getting an education during quarantine I feel quite lucky to met someone who also is in grad school  were going on a tea and art gallery meet up for a first date

I just wanted to share a positive story ",0,338
so i tried the fake GPS stuff on android but it appears to not be working maybe i did it wrong but i dont think i did so yeah the title is basically what my question is,0,168
"I f find it weird when in the first few exchanges the person asks if we can meet up often accompanied by Im not much of a texting person I havent even had the time to tell by your texting or voice messages if we will vibe even I know youll never know until we meet up but I kind of think tough luck youre on an app what were you expecting Often guys have this in their bio too which I find super offputting 
I dont want to spend weeks texting but I need some more info to feel like youre not a creep or to save each other valuable time 

Is this weird  too uptight 

Ill say that when Ive answered is it okay if we text some more first Most have been understanding or never replied haha",0,686
"In the past Ive matched with people who reply to my messages in 13 minutes no matter what time of day it is 

I think its great that theyre replying quickly but it gives me the impression that theyre always glued on their phone and not doing anything else with their lives I know this is an assumption and that I may be mistaken

Is it wrong to think of this as a turn off",0,372
"So I used to have bumble boost lifetime and got upgraded to premium lifetime when they put it out I seem to get every feature except for the weekly spotlights I contacted support and they said they I had boost not premium even though my settings clearly say I have premium Has anyone else run in to this before I messaged them back with a screenshot showing premium and they never replied

On a side note the only way Ive ever been able to rematch with someone is through a push notification Is there supposed to be another way to do that Im on android",0,552
"Just wondering what it means when it says

City name X distance away 

City name X distance away

City name only no distance

Ive searched and seen many differing explanations eg the tilde  symbol in the distance means the user has been inactive Or if theres only the city name they havent opened the app",0,304
"So first off I thought the concept behind this app was pretty progressiveforward thinking in that the women message first It prevents an unsolicited duck photograph from being sent as the first message and when a woman actually matched AND messages me firstit lets me know she may have actually taken the time to read my bio or is otherwise genuinely interested I also really appreciate the fact that I can filter people out who dont have or want kids since Im pretty firm on being CF and antinatalist

That being said I think its a little predatory due to there being a 24 hour time limit once a match is made We all have lives and many things can transpire in that time frame If a message isnt sent in that windowthe connection could be gone forever Having to throw money at this thing just to extend that timer is about as bad as microtransactions in insert big budget video game here I refuse to fall for it Im probably wrong or thinking too much about this but it makes me wonder if whoever developed this thing secretly wanted those who werent loaded to feel inferior I assume women also have to pay to extend the timer too Correct me if Im wrong",0,1152
"This is from what happened to me and Id also like to know for future reference from a female perspective
Ive decided that a good way to gauge if shes interested when Im undecided whether a date vibe went well or not is to ask her to text me when she gets home
I asked this girl to do that right before she left and she acknowledged However she never did
I didnt text her and I never heard a peep She was sweet but when she left I felt like it was too quick of a hug goodbye I decided to put the ball in her court that way to see if she showed interest
Id just like to know if that was a good way to gauge it or if she may have felt like I was being odd to say something like that or may have still wanted me to try a bit harder and reach out",0,741
Took a verification photo and suddenly all my pics are flagged and flags anything I upload I didnt think I had to do my make up and get totally cute for the verification photo but I guess the algorythm is basically misgendering me,0,230

So Im an guy and just wondering does the BFF let you see the opposite sex at all and a little less pressure just being friends and going from that vs the dating side I swear i tried to use the BFF side before and it only showed guys I feel like i dont have too many male friends unless theyre into video games or Trading card games magic the gathering etc Im not big on sports or any of that so i feel i dont have a lot in common with guys With female friends theyve usually been my concert or movie going buddies And maybe you hope it turns into more and if it doesnt at least you got a friend,0,594
"Ok Im honestly annoyed of myself for even posting this lol and i know im overthinking but Id love some advice

a few months ago I was on bumble and matched with this guy who I thought was super cute Im kind of picky on these apps and he was hands down the hottest guy id seen I messaged him and basically just said hi lol He never responded and the match expired I was bummed but realized i probably shouldve put more effort in my message A little while later i made a tinder and saw him there again and this time i decided to super like him  which ive never super liked a guy before We matched again on tinder but he didnt say anything  i was being prideful and thought since i super liked him he shouldve said something so i just decided to let it go and forget about him

I eventually took a much needed break from the apps and deleted all my profiles bc ive been traveling and had a lot going on About 2 weeks ago after a few months away I downloaded bumble and of course we matched again This time though I sent a better first message and he actually replied and we had a few back and forth messages He said he barely checks bumble and asked for my insta I gave it to him

Its been 56 days my insta is private and i havent received a request from him nor did i get another message on bumble He did put his insta on his bumble profile so im wondering if i shouldve just added him originally instead of sending him my profile and waiting for him to add meidk

I have other matches im interested in and am going on a first date with someone else this week so there is a part of me that knows i should just let this go since this dude clearly doesnt care and isnt really trying as im pretty sure hes been on bumble since i last messaged him  but if im being honest out of all the hundreds of profiles ive seen hes definitely the most attractive to me which is why its kinda hard for me to forget about him lol

Ive never double messaged a guy before and am wondering if i should in this situation And if i do what do I say Or do I just go ahead and add him on insta since he he literally includes it in his bio Or do i just let it go ty for your help",0,2151

Ive just noticed that all of my best pictures are of me outside because thats where I get the best light and dressed the best My problem is that a lot of those also happen to be near trees because of where I live So 56 of my photos are me with a background of leaves or a tree None of them are selfies theyre all different outfits and Ive been told they all look good but it just stands out to me that it gives the impression that Im living in the woods when the truth is thats just the only time Im not in pajamas Is this a problem and if it is should I add some of my worse looking pictures that show me doing something indoors or are there other areas I should try to get photos Is it a bad thing if a majority of my photos are taken in a similar environment,0,761
okay so im 21 M and all this time i wasnt ready to get in a relationship for this past week i have been thinking and i have realised that maybe its time since its still covid time and im not on campus its hard to meet people and im not a very social person i created a bumble account but dont have a premium one i was wondering if buying a subscription is worth it any advice would be appreciated thank you,0,406

"When I first tried OLD I used my real first name and a crazy dude found where I live I stopped using my real name I also dont use photos that can be reverseimage searched and lead back to me I dont give out identifying details or my phone number Many men think Im going overboard cant you tell Im a good guy And after all that I should be safe right

 About 8 months ago I relaunched my profile for about a 2week period No one stood out so it didnt go beyond a handful of brief conversations Brief because I limit how much time I waste by not going beyond asking two unreciprocated questions Mostly I get wordy responses where they try to impress me with how incredible and amazing they are I get it you want to put your best foot forward but if you only want to talk about you without wanting to get to know the other person there is an underlying pathology there I have no interest in unraveling I know all I need to know and unmatch 

So thats what happened 8 months ago Feel free to read the long exchange but Ill sum it up a guy Id briefly chatted with once and after asking two questions unmatched

1 found what he thought was my first name it wasnt but it was close

2 took the time to find my cell number which required a paid service because this is the one number thats intentionally unpublished

3 found what he thought was my birthday 

4 created a contact in his phone with my info

5 set a calendar reminder to reach out 8 months later

6 then lied about all of the above while using disappearing text which according to our investigator  a former cop  is difficult to screenshot so generally used to hide what people dont want others to easily see andor scare the recipient who thinks their phone  watch is hacked 

7 used a phone number thats not associated with his name via the usual channels  a professional found him which he clearly was not expecting 

7 tried gaslighting me into believing that wed connected all that time ago but just lost touch and that he didnt really know who I was but was such a good guy he didnt want to miss out on wishing me the best on my not birthday because silly Siri had automatically added the reminder with contact information I never gave

8 when I told him I knew who he was lied about it So I sent him a screenshot with his face on it professional background checks take time but I had enough preliminary info to find a photo  though omitted from the texts due to privacy issues I marked the spot with pic

 etc

ampx200B

I was a total stranger that had a single conversation with this person But I hurt his feelings by not being interested so he invested both money and time into finding my information so he could harass me 8 months later He mustve used an aggregator service so the information was mostly wrong but did give him my number 

Heres the scarier part this man is a dentist with a clinic He has access to private patient information that unwitting patients willingly provide which he can use in a similar way There is no way this is the first time hes done something like this as evidenced by the disappearing text

Im lucky I have access to resources that the average woman does not He clearly wasnt expecting that the tables would turn and that hed be the one terrified But this is not normal So if youre wondering why youre not having luck online and women are hesitant to meet you or give you their number think about what theyve had to deal with",0,3423

"According to the 2019 census 131 of Americans have a masters doctorate or professional degree If you ask me that sounds arounf 57 too low but its still useful

I looked that up after noting that seemingly 23rds of hundreds of profiles I a guy looking at womens profiles from late 20s to mid 40s swiped through claimed to have graduate degrees 

I started counting 77 out of 113 profiles claimed graduate degrees thats 68 of that small sample over several days of swiping I live about 20 minutes outside of Denver but noticed the same phenomenon in Austin both big cities so these groups arent representative of the total population but it still seems really high at least 50 higher than the country average

Does this matter for dating Not at all Only as an indication that people might be lying about their education on dating apps people lie on apps say it aint so or as an indicator of a possibly stupendous education inequality between urban centers and rural America or maybe between women and men 

We need more samples

I do find that large descrepancy really interesting and would love to know what other peoples counts are on this app Obviously this is informal and will be about small sample populations so not real data but if you want to count how many graduate degrees are listed and how many profiles you looked at and maybe basic location like Im around a major city looking at mens profiles or the like I think it would be interesting anecdotes for some of us on here

Ive been using Bumble on and off from before the pandemic and got back on a month ago and there are SO many more married poly nonmonogamous men popping up I have kids and filtered on the basis of someone else who has kids and that may be why I see so many of those men but it feels almost like a violation of the rules for married people to be on the app since theres no way to filter them out from actual single people Maybe Bumble can create a mode just for people wanting affairs or swinging so the date mode can stick to single people,0,538

It doesnt help that I have this whole paranoia about dating in the first place because Ill never know if a guy actually likesfinds me attractive when a lot of guys whether desperate or just because theyd rather not be single will just date someone if they can regardless of how much they like the girl

Sorry for the rant but the app has made this paranoia worse for me When I swipe on someone its because they seem like someone Id be interested in but guys dont get as many options so they dont do that ",0,1059
So I messed up I have premium so I get the beeline thing but I didnt realize that if I swiped left on someone they wouldnt ever see my profile So anybody who didnt put any information on their profile just pictures I swiped left on thinking if they were the kind of person I would get a long with they would swipe right on mine Well now almost nobody anywhere near me will ever see my bumble profile is there anyway to like reset without loosing premium Cause fool that I am choose permanent premium,0,499
hey yall this is probably a hot topic on this subreddit but Im just genuinely lost on how to start a conversation I have used both Bumble and Tinder and prefer Bumble because of the better conversations and style of app but I overthink a lot and never end up sending the first message we not going to get into the deep rooted trauma associated with this rn Im moving to my college town at the end of the summer so Im hoping to get some advice on what first message guys like to receive I consider myself pretty good with engaging in conversation otherwise but that first initial message I always have trouble with Any and all advice is appreciated ,0,648
"The gay dating pool on bumble let alone any dating app can feel like quite the puddle When I first used these apps a couple years ago I was freshly eighteen and optimistic and had a lot of fun 

But now all that happens is I pass by the same men in my preferred age range over and over again the pangs of not being of any interest to them super acute and the time it takes me to delete the app only gets shorter and shorter I cant wait and keep the app open because it makes me feel so insecure and undesired 

Once I get off the app I feel like myself again and feel confident and handsome and desirable 

The great big question is why does my bouts of loneliness convince me this time will be different everytime God",0,718

When I put my matches on men I get 288282991 super likes I change it to women and I am ignored Does this happen to anyone else who is not heterosexual on bumble I feel like in correct me if Im wrong the LGBT that their are insane beauty standards I would not consider myself conventionally attractive Im not ugly Its just a pattern Ill get over 100 matches with men and zero for women Does this happen to anyone else in the community I know the whole swipe on everyone thing is rampant for men online So I always wait for a man to like my profile without me swiping because the thought of swiping for a boyfriend makes me feel desperate af lmfao Im female btw,0,659

"Double standard with Pictures

Honestly its annoying that as a guy I am expected to have super exiting photos cant just be nice pictures needs to be me doing something exiting or being somewhere exotic or in another countryat a landmark 99 of women on these apps have generic ass pictures maybe a friend in their or a pet the occasional not my child picture if they are skinny likely a bikini picture if bigger an obscure photo that tries to hide the size of their waste then the attractive friend in every photo so you can tell who is who But yeah nothing ever extravagant but they dont need it because guys will swipe right regardless

Bio double standard

This pisses me off even more tbh because sorry but the vast majority of women on both bumble and tinder dont put anything or actually insert age I try to put an actual bio that works but doesnt seem to do anything 

Current bio I am a security guard I love RTV and Im looking for someone to travel to Europe with
love board games Im a Science and History Buff and Im a great cook and Baker
Learning German my dream job is to create my own showsuccess film channel I also love to cuddle

I cant just put something like Looking for GF or Want to have a baby or any other short thing because thats boring or a turn off but hi isnt for girls

Everything else

The standard is just 10 times higher for men than women on these apps and on top of that we have do deal with thots who are just trying to sell shit or those who just doing it for fun or just want friends despite it not being for that no one is looking to just be your friend dummy

Its so bad that had I not moved I likely would have had better success by simply going though Starbucks drive through because one of the baristas was making heavy hints and so yeah thats how fucking shitty these apps are drive throughs are better than them lol

WHAT DO YOU WANT None of that All women are different bullshit Clearly not or dating apps would be successful for both sides",0,1984
yes a dumb question im seeing this lovely woman and were texting off the app but i occasionally check our chat on bumble to see if i missed anything from the chat on bumble prior to seeing each other fking weird i know but i think this is my anxiety always needing to check things ANYWAY i swipes on one of her messages and just wanted to see if theyd get a notification,0,370
"I used to use Tinder exclusively until a good female friend told me she preferred using Bumble because women have to make the first move essentially

I thought that was really cool so I made a profile and got to swiping Slow at first but I eventually started matching with women I was really interested in

After 24 hours of silence I gave the first couple of matches the extra day to open the conversation 

Nothing 

Ive used the app for over a year now and have made IMO a good number of matches in that time

And I have never gotten a single opening message from any of them

"I get maybe ten profiles every few days and then get the no more matches left in your area message It sucks but I dont want to actually make my area or age ranges any wide than it already is There just arent enough lesbians in my area to keep swiping on forever 

As Im sure you all know Bumble constantly sends these messages Today was Keep swiping to find more possibilities And yet when I go in what do you know still no new profiles since I swiped last night I know its probably automated or something but its getting very annoying Last time I looked there was no way to turn off these updates without having no notifications on at all",0,639

Of course dating is shallow and of course people have the right to cut things off but why not just be honest Its patronising to lie If youve changed your mind after a makeup free photo just admit it",0,513
I dont get how i can get 15 likes in the first night surely theres people out there who find me attractive and then after two weeks i get nothing at all Been 2 weeks since i had a match Does bumble bury your profile after a while Also i remade my account 24 hours after i deleted my last one so maybe thats a factor And it wasnt the first time i remade my account,0,363

"So bubble hasnt exactly been terribly fruitful for me but there are lots of possibilities why that might be physically maybe my profile is trash maybe Im not really ready to find someone  etc 

Im curious after seeing so many women bemoaning being back on bumble what it feels like on the other side of the app I can sum up my experience like this swipe hundreds of times lots of matches that I assume are bots geared towards getting me to buy premium Get occasional real match convo starts with wave emoji start talking try to be casual but interesting eventually find out that we arent suited for each other or convo dies a sudden death if I dont carry every bit of dialog 

Does it suck this much as a woman Do you feel any more agency or control than this Or is this the essence of online dating for everyone",0,812
Im an American in Japan and had really great experiences with bumble in the states I met my most longterm now exbf on this app and so decided to give it a go in Japan And boy has it been sheit Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience to mine My type is not at all japanese so my only options boil down to military fuckbois or socially awkward guys with yellow fever this is a generalization of course but fairly accurate from first hand experience Back in the states I would basically match with 90 of the people I swiped right on but here I barely get any matches I live far away from Tokyo but still within range to see those matchesbut my profile is never shown to those users because Im too far out Why show me matches and waste my time swiping if you dont even show them my profile in return I know this is true because the minute I step into Tokyo I get loads of matches Its so frustrating and feels like a waste of time I also have been called a transvestite by three different men on this app Japan you can really pick em which I have NEVER gotten back in the states Literally disgusts me that men think its okay to accuse me of lying about my gender and say i look like a mani have very feminine features regardless so Im assuming these people are trying to hate on woman especially when theyre trying to date me Great tactic they got going Moving back to the states in july so giving up on this app for the time being If anyone has similar experiences please share as I would love to complain about the dating culture here together haha,0,1559

Hi I F37 was in a very long term relationship that ended almost a year ago Last night I decided that I was ready to try online dating and at my friends urging signed up for bumble I woke up this morning to over 300 likes and as of now there must be at least 500 guys in my beeline For every guy I swipe left on it seems two or three new ones pop up Its simply too many to swipe on let alone to take the time to look at their profiles I cant get to the bottom of the list This doesnt seem manageable at all Of course its very nice that Im getting interest but it almost seems like it cant be real interest Is this how it is when youre a new face on online datingyou get a barrage of men swiping rightand do you find the interest quickly dies down,0,745

"So I have been getting a lot of matches and greeting them only for them to leave me on read until the time runs out

So frustrating

I will just assume that they spam swiped right and got matched with me only to find that I was someone they were not interested in based on my profile Nothing wrong with not being interested but I wish more people would take the time to look at the profiles before swiping right

At least things have been better on BFF mode Met a few new acquaintances on there",0,494
"Been using bumble for a year or so usually get a couple matches each time Everytime Id use the app it would show like 14 likes and I could actually look at the blurred image to get an idea of who they were and get a chunk of the likes to be matches Id always get to the couple of likes every time before the swipe limit

Starting Id say about 12 weeks ago suddenly I always have 10 likes which I never get to even if I go on a tangent of disliking like 2030 people in a row

Was wondering if anyone else suddenly has an increase in likes that you never actually get to Seems like a slimy way of bumble to try to get you to buy their premium",0,640

Hey all huge noob here just posting to find some advice I just saw a crush I had in high school on here and am wondering what to do From what I know bumble keeps inactive profiles in the swipe stacks so I could just never match Id like to reach out to her on snapchat because weve already added each other in high school and it would definitely be easier to get her attention imo Just wondering if what Im about to do would be too weird Id probably just shoot her a text addressing her by her name and saying I saw her bumble profile and that Im not too sure how the app works so I figured id just text her on snap Might say I always found her cutepretty not sure if this would be too weirdcreepy since we never really spoke much other than a few words here and there in HS We have a lot in common so I think I know what Id do with the conversation after that first message just looking for some advice on breaking the ice Thanks,0,929
So I met a girl on bumble and we hit it off had great first date Were talking after and it seems like theres gonna be a second date Anyway I just logged into hinge for the first time in a while and saw that she also liked me there I think its super cute and was gonna say something like hey I saw you liked me here and it made me smile but Im a bit hesitant because I feel like its generally a bad idea to mention logging onto a dating app with someone Im currently seeing What do you all think,0,494
I want to know if this has happened to anyone else and if you were able to resolve it Two weeks ago I added a new photo to my bumble profile It is of me in a low cut wrap crop top Its my favorite top and I loved the pic of me A minute after I added it to my profile I received a pop up message that my photo was flagged for nudity I guess their photo recognition software detected it as nudity But my boobs werent showing it was just cleavage I emailed customer service two weeks ago and Ive yet to receive a response They are normally prompt about getting back to me,0,567
"So Im not referring to people who take 15 days to respond Heres what I mean 

I normally respond to everyone in a day and understand that not everyone can respond quickly But there are some matches that consistently take a week to a month to respond 

Itll go something like 

I respond within 24 hours 
They respond a week later 
I respect within 24 hours 
They respond 3 weeks later 

I understand that people are busy but after a certain point it feels like they dont really value the conversation enough to respond in a timely manner So I reciprocate that 

Again I wouldnt feel like this if they took 15 days to respond but sometimes it goes way beyond that like literally a month multiple times Idk

But instantly right after I did that I was like what the hell did I just do I actually really want to meet up with this guy but I didnt even get his number 

So of course I deleted my profile and remade it so I can swipe on him again its a small area super easy to find his profile again but now Im wondering is he going to think Im desperate 

Its been a couple weeks at this point I could just swipe right and see if he also swipes right again OR i was thinking about super liking him its actually tinder not bumble  but I feel like thats so cringey Is it

I guess I just wanna know  if a girl that you wanted to meet up with randomly unmatched you mid conversation and you came across her profile again would you swipe right What if she super liked you

"Heres the back story and timeline before asking for advice 

May 2020 I matched with this super attractive guy and we were having great conversation similar sense of humor etc Unfortunately due to COVID we both left our current city to live with our parents in different states and the conversation fizzled out By March 2021 I moved back into the city and realized we were still matched and reached out and started talking again He was still not fully back in the city and spending a lot of time at home with his parents but suggested we grab drinks at some point when he was in town We chatted for a few more days and I asked when he might be back to make a plan and he didnt respond 

I stayed off bumble for a few months to focus on work but saw that were still matched It seemed like we had good chemistry and would like to meet in person but is it weird to follow up again and see if hes moved back if he didnt respond to my last message Id assume if he really wasnt interested or dating someone he would have unmatched or deleted his profile",0,1047

"Disclaimer right at the beginning Im absolutely no fan of the term friendzone and only use it cheekily here given the circumstances

Five weeks ago I got my first match that didnt expire or went nowhere after about three months on the site My first impression was rather mixed to be honest Our exchanges flowed rather naturally we had daily exchanges every evening she was willing to exchange numbers switching to voice messages fairly early and she was straight away talking about very personal worries but on the other hand never asked anything about me and ignored cues I gave to ask about stuff I hinted at I got the impression she used me as more of a complaint box about her life than anything else that she felt lonely and isolated and that shes using the App to get to know some new people So I continued the exchange with that in mind thinking that it would be a shitty thing to do to try to take advantage of her situation and rather offer myself as a friend instead I thought that would be something we could both profit from I just had to be a bit more proactive and interject on my own with my own stories from time to time

In any case already on the second day she mistook a question I asked about what she has seen of the city so far since shes an exchange student as an invitation to show her around and I thought What the hell what do I got to loose and rolled with it so we scheduled a meeting that took place two weeks later Given my impression I went there with absolutely no illusions about her having an interest in me and was perfectly fine just having a nice day with a stranger Which would be quite a win in book due to my intense social anxiety that kept me from doing any of this so far And overall I think it was a nice afternoon all things considered

Now comes the part where I think I messed up In one quiet moment she opened up saying that she has no interest in relationships at all and just wanted to use the app to talk with people and is confused why I who put relationship in my seeking has been humoring her like this without really pursuing her like it should be expected of a guy with that aim I who was absolutely not in the least surprised told her that I already got that impression and am perfectly happy just hanging out given that I myself really just using the app to go out and make some experiences and if that means getting a friend thats already a win I just didnt want to put that into my bio because I was told it would turn people off Later on towards the end of our tour she asked me after my Bumble experience and I admitted that on my side so far its been pretty bleak and she was the only person Ive been talking to for now

That the meeting wasnt all that bad I realized when during our messaging the next day she asked whether we could meet up the next weekend again I had to tell her that I couldnt promise anything because Im pretty busy with work but I could try to power through and free up a day so she should ask me again on Friday whether I succeeded We still messaged till Wednesday then Thursday and Friday I powered through like I said I would but her message never came Therefore on Saturday I thought to ask myself whether shes up for Sunday but I never got to it

When I asked about her day she replied that shes busy following up with a picture of a park shes been touring right now I made a in hindsight inappropriate joke that she must be busy enjoying the view Then in the middle of the night she replied with a rather harsh accusation that Im judging her for being happy After I explained that I was just joking she said that Im putting pressure on her by messaging her so often and that I should find my own way My first thought was that she mistook my attention as attention so I assured her that I understood that she has no interest in romance and that I have no hidden intentions and would just like to stay in contact because I think it would suck to drift apart so soon after meeting She only replied that I need to learn how to deal with girls and that its all fine despite the clear dismissal I was thinking that I maybe just caught her at an inopportune time where she was feeling depressed and that things would clear up on their own

Apparently they didnt After a week of not messaging her and not receiving a message either I grew impatient and asked about her week After a brief exchange about her having left the country for a spontaneous day trip I asked again whether I got it right that she doesnt want me to stick around She bluntly replied yes and when I asked how we are supposed to maintain a friendship like this she said that she doesnt like to stay in contact even with best friends so its all okay

I I must admit Im lost What did just happen Is that the acquaintancezone of the friendzone XD I suppose it is true that I have no idea how to deal with girls or rather with people in general",0,4894

"If you only have selfies headshots or obscure photos without a full body shot in any of your gallery photos I assume youre overweight 

And not that theres necessarily anything wrong with that but its the fact that youre effectively lying about your body image thats the problem To give you some perspective some people are looking for a fit or athletic partner to share an active and healthy lifestyle with If thats not you you need to be up front about that It would be a sacrifice that some people are not willing to make and if youre actively hiding something like that THAT is a huge dealbreaker all by itself

So I just went on a first date with a guy Id been chatting with for almost 3 weeks and it went well but not AMAZING We had been texting constantly and the convo was immaculate there Irl though it was just decent but there were a few awkward silences The place we went to was pretty loud so it was hard to hear each other at times Overall we talked for about two hours before we were kicked out of the restaurant cause they needed the table we were on It was nothing special but I think the environment and nerves definitely played a part because the conversation had a lot of potential As I was about to leave he asked if I wanted to do it again and I kinda froze up and agreed he noticed and messaged me later to say that he was sorry he put me on the spot Anyway I agreed to a second date because I think there may be potential but I cant help but feel a little disappointed Im also not too physically attracted to him he did like look his pics but I just wasnt that attracted What do you guys reckon,0,1002

We talk and I double check that she saw that I was poly and she had but was more just hoping for a friendship as she wasnt interested in being with anyone who already with someone I take this as a total win because friends are dope We keep talking for a few messages but when I went to reply this evening I saw her account was deleted While I am aware there was nothing romantic going to happen I was really enjoying talking with her and we seemed to have a lot in common

New Bumble user here so far Ive gotten 6 matches and out of those online one 1 of them actually texted me but the conversation didnt last long The other 5 didnt even bother to text me even though they were the first ones to like me every time I know this because when I was swiping I got the _its a match_ message Unlike Tinder and other apps where the main reason for girls not replying is because they have lots of matches in Bumble girls _should_ know that if they swipe right in someone is because they are going to talk to him right Because otherwise matches are just useless It makes zero sense to me,0,606

I had a really great time we went to a barcade had some beers played a few games etc He was really funny and made me feel comfortable I talked way too much but he was cool about it We later got ice cream walked around and then sat in his car and talked Weve been texting pretty consistently since and were making plans for next week 

I went a smidge out of my comfort zone when swiping on this guy but Im pretty glad I did he showed me a really great time And Im also really glad he was patient with me I know a lot of guys get discouraged if they havent met up with a girl within so many days but were adults and shit happens I dont have any high expectations for this Im mostly just having fun Well see",0,1129

"Question for the ladies here Im 28F living in a major metropolitan area I recently deleted my Bumble profile because the app kept telling me Id run out of people which is impossible because a I dont use any filters beyond politics and b I live in the middle of Los Angeles Im resolved to get back to it after Memorial Day but before I do I thought Id ask for tips 

1 How often do you check the app I read somewhere that users are rewarded for daily use but after two weeks of doing so I felt as if that wasnt true What are your experiences 

2 I hate to bring this up as a point of discussion but since its so unfortunately critical to online dating Im a pretty successful woman who takes really good care of herself When Bumble was working Id get maybe 2030 likes a day and that would translate to 12 matches a week Based on what you read here about women using this app I guess that would make me a bit abnormal soany tips on how to maximize matches I have a good profile with lots of pictures and Ive gotten positive feedback on it from a bunch of people too 

I think Bumble has a lot of potential but Im going to be honest and say that it has left me defeated and frazzled after two weeks of daily use I would love for it to work for me but I havent managed to squeeze a date out of it yet mostly because men leave the conversation hanging while its still happening So Any tipsstorieswords of encouragement would be great and much appreciated Thank you in advance ",0,1470

"I F23 met this guy M25 through Bumble at the end of February and he initiated the first date We grabbed drinks and we clicked really well I immediately noticed how good he was at initiating and following up on plans  we would proceed to meet up about once a week for the next 25 months going bowling listening to live music at a jazz bar picnic movie nights in etc We didnt have sex until the fourth or fifth date which made me think that he was looking for something more serious which I wouldve been down for if he was I started building up a romanticized version of him in my head and seeing the potential for us to become more And I took every little sign to further convince myself that this would work out forehead kisses toothbrush at his place holding hands in public straight up telling me he likes me too after I say it first telling me he missed me again after I say it first We even talked about how neither of us are seeing anyone else  we prefer to just see one person at a time We told each other personal things we have allegedly never shared with anyone else As much as I felt sure that this would lead to being serious together I was always so anxious about actually initiating a Define The Relationship conversation I was so afraid that bringing up the topic too early would just scare him off So I suppressed the urge telling myself that in time the conversation would come up naturally or he would eventually open up 

Tonight after a few days of silence he texted saying he wants to stop by my place to tell me something I braced myself for a breakup while pathetically hoping it could be a love confession Nope to the latter He told me point blank he wants to date other people and doesnt feel comfortable doing so if hes still seeing me

Once I got through I immediately deleted all those pictures from my Bumble profile but then it brought me right back to the beginning Uploading profile pictures that should match the verification picture

So I way too many times tried uploading pictures failing each time and now we are here Blocked for being fake 

Okay fair I understand why I just dont know if there are endless stupid pictures of me still on Bumble though Thats what Im worried about

Im fine with the initial verification text but I absolutely do not want any other texts from Bumble as my mom lives with us and tends to snoop She would be furious if she thought I was cheating which is crazy because Im almost never on my phone but shes also a very accusatory person Same thing with Tinder Im 99 sure I deleted my Tinder profile all those years ago but I went back in to double check and got a verification text Tinder also somehow got my email address and I do not want my partner nor my mom finding out I was ever on a dating app My partner would be fine but pretty sure my conservative mother would disown me

So I have two accounts or should I say HAD two accounts A month ago I had my main account where I did all the regular matching with women But then I decided to try and make a second account to test if I would get more matches with a different bio and pictures of me 

Then this morning I was shocked to see that my second account got banned supposedly due to people reporting my profile for inappropriate content where I thought talking dirty was allowed but now I guess it isnt I treated my second account as my main account and stopped using my first one because I was getting more matches on it 

After a month of not using my main account I logged back in with my Beeline having 50 women waiting for me to swipe right on them So I did I swiped until the daily limit and matched with about half of them But then when I came to the message section I noticed they were all gone All 25 of them disappeared

Plus women are inundated with matches Its unrealistic to think they have time to write a long intro as the first message and its not their job

"So Ive had tinder since like 2017 Back then it didnt seem to affect your rating to swipe right on everyone So Id swipe right on EVERY girl to get a higher match rate and see more women and ended up getting up to 1500 matches after a while with a lot being ones I wouldve swiped right on even if I was selective I never capitalized on that because I lived with my parents back then and didnt want to tell them I was using tinder plus I was focused on other things 

Now since I moved out in 2019 Ive gotten maybe a hundred matches I havent used tinder much and by the time I moved out I heard swiping on everyone ruins your rating so I quit doing that but lately I never get matches unless I boost Is bumble like this I dont even get likes from bots so clearly Im not being shown I wonder if Im shadowbanned but I havent done anything wrong since 2019 and even created a new account with a different numberpictures 

Before I spend money on bumble does it actually show you to other users fairly and does the visibility dry up after a week like with tinder I did get like 20 matches right after recreating my account and every now and then Ill still get a little surge of matches but Ill go months without matches so I never use tinder and its against their rules to create new accounts to get the visibility boost again

"This is just a theory but I think that having women message first does work against guys who arent in the top percentiles of attractiveness Women making the first move is still considered unconventional by social norms so it follows that women will be less likely to break convention for guys who are borderline or just OK 

I think a good litmus test for guys is whether women message you first on other apps if the answer is yes Bumble is probably for you Speaking for myself women almost never make the first move  maybe its the type of women I attract but Ive found this to be true in real life and OLD Random women introducing themselves or using funny openers is pretty much an alien concept The closest thing I can remember is having a girl come up to me after a volleyball game in hs and asking for my AOL IM name lol because her friend thought I was cute  I was so shocked I couldnt even talk 

Its a trip when I see people post funny things women say on the app as convo starters because its so outside my plane of reality To me its like watching people recite lines from Shakespeare  like if I try hard I can imagine a universe where people speak like this but its definitely a strange and magical universe",0,1217

"So Im 30M str8 in a huge city and looking for a relationship  something meaningful not a ONS 

Registered a week ago on Bumble and swiping left right I noticed a stark pattern of women who are physically really good looking but other than 34 pics of themselves say absolutely nothing about themselves 

And as a guy who has his life together is happy a feminist and someone whose main qualities in a woman are intelligence and independence I wanted to say a few things 

ampx200B

1 Why should I swipe right on you   
As I said Im looking for more than some empty sex what are your qualities Whats special about you How do you stand out 
2 Your looks are nothing that special on Bumble   
Yeah you are pretty but like 70 of women on Bumble look like top models for some reason
3 Who do you want to meet   
A guy like me isnt gonna swipe right on an empty profile no matter how you look whos left   
Guys who just swipe right on everyone or the superficial ones exactly the kind of guys I would totally understand you want nothing to do with
4 Dont be a cliche   
You like a guy with a good sense of humour Good Food Travel and have fun   
Congrats you are 90 of women on Bumble  boring
5 You want a feminist boyfriend   
So do I want a feminist girlfriend great But you start this entire thing by just posing there being pretty and doing nothing else And expect me to be funny charming and have this awesome opener after your hi and your empty profile   
Well guess what thats a by the book patriarchal expectation so from a feminist guy like its gonna be just a sigh next
6 About point 3 again  
Putting just a little bit of effort form your end will increase the quality of your matches by A LOT see point 3 again and ask yourself who do you want to meet Are you frustrated by meaningless hordes of guys Cant find someone nice 

Is it me just expecting way too much from humanity   
I once chatted with a woman about wanting to find a smart woman and she was like why would I be smart Thats hard work Specially when i can just put on a mini skirt and get 100 guys in 15min And I didnt even know what to answer her lol 

Want to get rid of the patriarchy Start form yourself and your relationship with men",0,2206

"Im a long time Bumble BFF and Bizz user After not having much success with it I decided to try coming up with something better I call it Passionfruit Here you can choose to only initiate when you feel something really strong about the other persons chosen passion Like it resonates and thats why you want to say hello You already have in mind somewhere you can take the conversation beyond small talk

My main idea behind this is that I personally find going through countless initial introduces quite exhausting This is doubly true when I dont feel there is much context for a connection mostly just their looks and a few generic data points I dont know but theres something about swiping on pictures for the purpose of platonic relationship building I have seen personally and also read anecdotally that some guys use it for gay dating

Women are probably better about this  I wouldnt know being a dude But I have heard women tend to have a better psychological fit for the existing platonic matchmaking models We3 Bumble BFF Hey Vina seem to all have a higher degree of success in matching women than men

Im not sure its appropriate to say what Ive made is specifically targeted to men but it definitely tries to prioritize things that one might geek out on or be really obsessed about over superficial traits For example expectant mothers have Peanut What do guys have

In any case I hope you folks will try out what weve made and let us know what you think Were continuing to make progress and pushing updates that improve the product around the edges But really were doing it for you and me I love making new lifelong friends So that means we want you to help us shape this over time

There is this ONE girl im very interested in and told myself no Fckboi talk   She texts me something about my bio i text her back we are kinda breaking the ice getting to know each other She got very responsive at the start starting getting fast replies from 23 hours to MINUTES so I thought to also keep it like that and we started texting back to back for a few hours suddenly I didnt receive a text the whole day made me overthink if i said something wrong about asking what program shes in

What made her so uninterested Was it the convos that were dry or is she genuinely busy My personal opinion is that they way the convo was opened up felt like she wants something casual   I feel like i can still bring back the heat after a few days by making a joke or something like that but any tips on what i should do next can be very helpful",0,1254

"Hi all

I just logged in and bumble asked me if I am still looking for a relationship I said yes and now apparently the app will prioritise showing me to people looking for the same thing and vice versa

I have already noticed that the first few people in my queue are looking for a relationship and there is a minor cosmetic change  it now puts what you are looking for right on your main profile pic rather than below the pic 

How do you all see this changing the current matching system I suppose it is basically a free filter really and is potentially good in the sense that you will end up seeing people after the same thing as yourself more often 

However I do often match and have dated with great people with no filter filled out so is a slight shame if I lose out on seeing this people now But on the other hand maybe it will lead to more people filling out the filter Either way I am interested to see how big a difference it makes and kudos to bumble for trying new things

"This is a follow up to my previous post httpswwwredditcomrBumblecommentsncfku6ill_finally_have_my_first_date_today_because_of

Im an 18 year old guy and Ive never been in a relationship before mostly because my mother was very strict about it as I grew up going through puberty Im a freshman and incoming sophomore at a 4year college now but the pandemic wasnt really making it easy to ask someone out in person so I resorted to online dating Ive been trying to avoid Tinder because most of the ladies in my area at the moment are only looking for hookups which got me to mainly stick with Bumble even though its so much drier here compared to Tinder  

As Ive said before my date thought that I was super handsome and gave me her Snapchat But I was skeptical with how she looked in the pictures on her profile because she used Snapchat lenses on all of them It turns out that she was indeed a catfish when I met her in person and her excuse was that her exbf fattened her up over the years and shes been hitting the gym to get fit again 

The date itself wasnt too bad actually I enjoyed the dinner and the conversation but since I couldnt feel any chemistry between us Id say she would fit better as just a friend and nothing more Despite that I still appreciated the opportunity and can use that experience towards future dates After the date I just walked her back home as we talked some more and didnt bother to do anything romantic like the cuddles I promised she just wasnt my type and I was quite disappointed that she catfished me She bought me a snack at the mini mart near her house for the ride back before we hugged each other goodbye

The next morning I found out that she blocked me on Snapchat and unmatched me on Bumble I took a huge deep breath in anger and slammed my fist onto the closet door and then gave myself a facepalm I SPENT ALMOST 200 DOLLARS IN UBER FARES FOR NOTHING Even though I figured that she mightve not been happy about me setting my expectations too high I was at least hoping that we could vibe as friends and play online video games once in a while but nooooshe had to do me dirty instead This honestly makes me want to quit online dating from now on or at least only date with matches who are much nearer to my location and the fact that much more people are getting vaccinated now especially helps I managed to find the girls Instagram and Im thinking about interrogating her on there Im just so pissed that this had to happen on a first date that I blew so much money on",0,2514

I have a few questions for mainly men Maybe I can get some light shed on these things Ive noticed 

If I get asked do you have snap on day 1 of matching I assume its for them to eventually ask me for nudes In my experience if Im asked for my snap its not going anywhere I want to be 910 times Ill get asked for pics and videos almost immediately Is this mostly accurate 

If they ask for my number sometimes I will give it before the first date but I usually say no Googling my number leads to too many sites where people can pay for my address One man asked me for my number 3 times within 36 hours and I had to break it off since he wouldnt respect my no He also asked me some other questions that made me uncomfortable but I digress Why do you want our numbers so quickly If I vibe with a guy sure But I have to be careful 

I own my own home Before I was in an apartment without roommates Ive noticed that men in my age preference 2332 will insist on coming to my house even after I say no and explain my preference for a public meeting Is it the prospect of getting laid I live with two protective dogs a 9mm and various sharp implements throughout my house for personal protection Why push

"Quick back storymessaged with this girl for 5 days before our video chat on day 6 Everything seemed fine except for the fact that she only sent 2 messages a day Now I dont want to seem like I need constant attention every minute but 2 short messages in 24 hours is a bit low It was on day 3 that she set up a specific date and time to chat Once she did that I was a little more ok about her not messaging as muchgotta save stuff for the video chat I guess 

So the video chat comes Starts at 7 Even though I hate video chatting we ended up talking for an hour and it went surprisingly well At about 757 she abruptly started to say something like she was getting ready to go At the same time she began I started a question for her She gave me a real quick answer unlike before Then right after we said our goodbyes 

When it was done I talked to a female friend of mine and told her how it went I said it went good but joking added that she quickly ended the conversation exactly at an hour like she had some other appointment to get to My friend asked me if I ever saw her taking any notes And I was taken back for a second because I DID At least 4 or 5 times I didnt think about it much at the time because I thought maybe it was just a shopping or a todo list or something And my friend said ya you were probably just her 7 oclock and she had to get ready for her 8 oclock

I couldnt believe it Like not only is it rude as fuck to take notes about someone WHILE talking to them like its a job interviewwe already talked for 5 days and just talked for an hour straightyou cant remember anything or just write it down later 

I realize girls get a lot more attention and have tons of messages and guys to go through but finding out that I was being formally interviewed after the fact just totally ruined it for me 

During the conversation and at the end I had full intentions to want to chat with her again and ask her out on a normal date But since that day 4 days ago neither of us have messaged eachother She didnt unmatch with me yet so I guess thats a good sign but now I have no desire to write her anymore Fuck I was the one being interviewed Shouldnt the employer be contacting ME next

I dont know I cant imagine what those notes say Probably brutal But also could be a learning experience if I knew what they did say I just wonder what she would have said if I brought it up Im guessing she would either lie or be completely nonchalant about it like its completely normal 

Overall Im just glad I didnt realize what was going on until after the fact I cant imagine how even more awkward Id be if I knew she WAS making detailed notes about me Id be stressing over one bad awkward joke while I see her do a half smile and chuckle and quickly start writing something down furiously",0,2790

Has anyone experienced this out of nowhere",0,641

"So very new to bumble and the whole dating scene in general and I have no idea what to do and what to say  Doesnt help that Im an introvert and take my Time in talking and opening up to people 
How soon after talking is to soon to meet  Esp since this one guy who texted some three sentences to me asked if I wanted to meet immediately after knowing that Im visiting the place and will be gone in two weeks  Not into the hook up scene at all so didnt go 
 
Are there any dos and donts for this app  
Just any suggestions in general would be appreciated",0,552
When I visited Maine I noticed that when I used Bumble there was a separate section where you could select whether or not you use marijuana Does anyone know how this feature gets implemented in legal states Im from NJ and since NY and NJ both just legalized I am curious as to when I can expect to see this feature on the app back home,0,335
Seriously the whole point is that women have to message first Swiping right means youre at least a little interested Finally after MONTHS got an actual match Gave her the extra day and everything and she just lets it expire So I really gotta ask ladies if youre not gonna message on the app specifically about women making the first move why are you even on this,0,362

"Im 18 turning 19 soon F so Im pretty new to the dating scene I posted this on rTinder but it got removed for some reason 

I matched with this 20 year old guy from my uni on tinder The first thing he asks is are u free I say not rn and he says he really wants to meet He suggests coming over to my place to watch a movie I suggest meeting at a cafe but he says its cold I saw where this was going and made it very clear that I dont want sex He said thats fine and he wouldnt want to have sex on the first date 

I suggest this movie and turns out weve both watched it but wouldnt mind watching again I say he can come over today evening 

This all happened yesterday I woke up this morning and started to get a really bad feeling I havent given him my address yet thankfully so Im thinking of cancelling 

The weird thing that stood out to me was he didnt care about getting to know me all he cared about was wanting to meet I was the only one asking questions like where are you from what do you do etc Ive been talking to other guys on bumble and tinder and they do ask genuine questions which makes me feel safe 

Part of me wants to go ahead with the date cos Ive never had a boyfriend Also staying in and watching movies is my ideal date but it feels weird for a first date with a stranger I want to prioritise my safety over my need for a boyfriend but I cant decide Please help Thank you in advance 

TLDR Guy I met on tinder wants to come over watch a movie and cuddle Ive made it very clear I dont want to have sex but I still feel iffy because he didnt make an effort to get to know me",0,1595

"People have gotten way too comfortable with anglesfiltersmakeup changing and hiding who they really are I started looking for dates and got a few dating apps this week So far the matches were ok and Ive had 45 virtual dates 

Maybe Im just bad at being able to tell or this is the norm and I just havent experienced this like everyone else Most of them clearly were not the people in their profile The others didnt work for other reasons and thats ok I think the ones that had a different face or had gained weight could have maybe worked for something less serious now that I feel lied to I see no point in talking with them 

Attraction is not only about your body type You can be forward funny and honest and I probably would have still talked to the real version of them Someone thats out of my weight preferences that has a picture of them working out or saying they eat well and are working on themselves is great and shows you are working on yourself Accept and show who you are If you dont like something about yourself try and change what you can and be content with the things you cant be",0,1098

" I never even hear about people going on dates i mean here on reddit I read about it and such but this seems to be only on reddit

IRL people i know literally never talk about dates they went on whoa im dating this nice girl

i went on a nice date with a guy last night that i met nah its bruh i plowed this censor and censor on her face i even took pics look look

its all hook up sex literally its all i hear about a girl i knew at my old job told me how at a work party a guy just walked up to her and asked her if she wanted to go back to his place for sex all night and she agreed no dating no courting just sex or no sex no sex fine and go up to the next girl hook up sex hmmm interested in hook up sex no ok next

wtf

Even people who have girlfriends or boyfriends IRL started as just hook up sex casual sex then they eventually just settled no dating no courting

I never went on a date or had sex ive never been close to a woman except one time and it was awkward and before you troll me and say how much did you have to pay her hahaha I HATE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT

Everytime I think a girl maybe likes me its haha yeah right good luck just shaming me and making fun of me for having hope

A girl kissed me on the cheek one time and if i tell anyone about it how much did it cost hahaha it didnt cost anything she sat on my lap and kissed my cheek FOR FREE

I just dont understand if people actually go on dates I fantasize about what dating is like and maybe slowly leading to sex but it just seems hook up sex is what happens and people dont waste their time dating anymore cause hook up sex is all that matters",0,1621
"Ive always gone for a super weird approach personally Well not always but recently Ive been playing around with something weirder since Im not used to opening and a hey or how are you used to bore me to death Online dating is a long tedious process that rarely yields results worth a darn What catches your eye or impresses you in an opener

"So I have used Bumble in the past and had some good experiences however  once the pandemic hit I feel like the quality of men really went down  They stopped looking at it as a dating site and more of a hook up

I am currently not even talking to anyone so I thought why not try bumble again I didnt want to go through the hassle of creating a whole profile and fill everything if I didnt find any of the men attractive again I asked my friend in anther state if I could use her pictures just to see what kind of men there are in my area  She agreed and I picked a regular looking picture of her and a second one where shes in sweats looking down so not the most eye capturing photos My friend is gorgeous but I specifically picked pictures that would be seen at best as cute I also didnt full out absolutely anything on the profile I wanna be clear my intent was not catfish or trick anyone as I just wanted to see what the options are 

I started swiping and after a while only saw like 7 men I would actually swipe right on  started to get discouraged  I saw a guy I used to date and remembered he said that he rarely swiped right on women so I decided to see if that was true and tried to match him After this I thought well I wonder how many guys just swipe on any girl they see The answer was shocking As I started swiping right on everybody to see how many matches I would get it was overwhelming just a bunch of matches from men who clearly dont even care who they are swiping on  I knew that was a thing and I am fully aware that OLD is a numbers game but I dont know how I would feel going back on there knowing that the guy Im talking to could be one those men who just shoots his shot at everyone It makes the whole thing seem even more disingenuous  If I meetsomeone in real life yeah they could be talking to multiple people but at least I know they had to make a little effort and think about approaching me instead of just flicking their thumb What do you guys think",0,1981
So I have a date with one of my bulbs matches this weekend We live in LA so the covid situation is pretty good here and we are both vaccinated Before covid people of opposite sex would usually greet each other with a brief hug on a date Is that still acceptable in these circumstances or should I just wave or something  Lol,0,324
ive been talking to this guy for a while now and everything seemed to be going well but today when I went to look at my messages he wasnt there there wasnt that unmatched notification that you get when someone unmatches you and there isnt an account deleted thing either his profile simply disappeared does that mean Ive been blocked because I cant think of anything else,0,371

"So Im mostly on Bumble looking for something casual mostly a hook up or fwb But as a guy I really dont want to creep anyone out by being too upfront talking about sex I know that even if a girl is interested in casual sex she can get easily turned off if youre too blunt and just jump to asking to fuck

I understand general advice like just be confident just be respectful etc But specifically Id like to hear if any women who have hooked up with guys on bumble can describe the details of the conversation leading up to it In past conversations how was a guy able to directly ask about hooking up without giving off gross vibes

"Hey everyone I hope this is allowed here

I recently launched an apphttpswewatchappxyz where people find what movies to watch together You swipe right on movies you want to watch and it shows you what you and your friends are both willing to watch together By the way its not monetized at all I just wanted to make something fun

People have told me that they dont have anyone to watch these movies with but that I can show them to each other

I already tried looking up the reason for this and on the bumble website it just says that women make the first move and literally there is no reason behind it apparently Why would men not be able to make the first move If you ask me that isnt gender equality considering the developers made it so men cant message first because they were born a man but women can because they were born a woman and have the power and the choice,0,428
I matched with this girl her first message was asking for my Instagram username cause I was kind of advertising my Instagram photography profile in my bio I sent her my username but its been 4 days and she hasnt responded I was told by another girl that you have to pay to keep on messaging someone you matched with Is that true If so thats very stupid,0,352
Hey everybody I went on a date with a girl and it was more of a hookup A few days later I was signed out of Bumble and its not loading correctly to put me back into the app Im assuming that my account was banned Im assuming that this girl said something so bizarre to the support representatives to get my account taken down Ive been on dating apps since before 2016 and I always respect Community guidelines and talk to everybody with respect As of today I am now banned from what used to be called Hot or Not It said that I received too many reports against my account and they had to take it down Whats going through my mind is that this girl is trying to get me removed from every dating app possible After I left her that night what seems pretty weird is that she screenshotted my profile on Snapchat and never spoke to me again Any thoughts on this,0,854

30M here FYI This question doesnt apply to the ones who apparently dont know they have to start the conversation This is for the ones who know full well how Bumble works but for whatever reason let the match expire rather than un matching Is it forgetfulness Is it too accumulate matches for a profile boostvalidation Is it lack of interest in the match Im asking partly out of frustration due to me finally getting a decent match recently after months of nothing but never getting a chance to talk with her,0,507
"I matched with a guy about a month ago on Bumble and we hooked up a couple times since then We texted and sexted regularly and I felt like we really hit it off We had a lot in common and both felt really comfortable with each other the moment we first met up  no awkwardness whatsoever We talked about future dates and seemed mutually interested in each other However he completely stopped responding to my texts and snaps about a week and a half ago

I had my old bumble account for about a year with the same settings as my current account and I never once ran out of people I live in a city of millions and my settings are fairly wide in terms of age and distance given that I live in a densely populated area Ive had my new account for 2mo and I am already running out of people I dont swipe right on everyone I am very selective and I dont even use bumble that frequently since Ive run out of people its not fun anymore Ive contacted bumble about the problem but they tell me to widen my settings Their response doesnt make sense because my old profile was the same but I didnt have this problem The only variable thats different is that I have a new profile Any suggestions,0,727

"So it seems that a lot of my old matches are gone I have left exactly 15 now I was wondering if this happened to anyone else recently By matches I mean conversations so I lost a lot of conversations that I had and wanted to keep

I had a lot more than 15 so it seems very unlikely that they all unmatched me at the same time",0,409
"I mean the short term fix is once I found out theyre a scammer I report first and move on That being said there was one person I matched with that was really convincing that they were legit up until they mentioned that they were looking for a sugar daddy I replied thats not something Im into but no kink shame intended To each their own ya know


Now Im at work and m busy so a few hours go by and I check bumble again to see whats going on Next thing I know she unmatched and I got a big warning on my screen that said bumble takes reports seriously and if it happens again Im gonna be banned further action taken or whatever Sooo that was a surprise to me I hadnt said anything rude or crude but the warning went into effect anyway Whats to stop some random person having a bad day from going in matching with people and then reporting all of their matches What if Im one of them and I get banned now because a scammer and someone else that was having a bad day screwed me over

I assume this kind of stuff is permanent so now should I just unmatch people as soon as I get even the slightest hint of scummyness I reached out to bumble via their contact me via email thing but I dont know if they can even do anything about it or see the message chain to know for certain that I didnt say anything rude or abusive or whatever

"To be honest I dont have a lot of dating experience period I married the first guy I dated seriously and after 33 years we officially separated last August 8 months of enjoying singlehood and last week I decided to see what my options are Most guys give monosyllabic responses but Mike was different Not only full sentences and even complete paragraphs he actually engaged It is no exaggeration when I say over the next 3 days we only stopped chatting all through the app to sleep at night From Wednesday morning through Friday night we had silly conversations serious discussions and flirting It was going great so we decided hed drive almost 2 hours to my small tourist town to spend the day this past Saturday I offered to meet somewhere halfway but he insisted it was worth his effort

It was 1230am when we said our final goodnights looking forward to meeting in person in only a few hours He even sent me a voice recording saying how much he was looking forward to it I woke up at 630 that morning and reached for my phone I knew it was too early for him to be awake but I wanted to hear the recording again Opened the app go to messages    and hes gone After scrolling down I discover he has unmatched from me We didnt exchange phone numbers or last names he doesnt know my address so hes poof disappeared I had hoped at first it was just an accident but have come to realize I was being played Have fun convincing the old fat lady someone actually likes her Big time fun to be had by all

"How to get alot of matches you ask With little time investment Without buying anything

Delete your account

Sign up to a new account you may use the same phone number

Complete your profile

This is the period where your profile will be viewed the most

Your match queue will become high but dont sweat and dont buy premium

Swiping on girls is pretty much pointless at this stage since chances are bumble will not show these individuals your profile so a match is unlikely

Wait 3 days

Swipe right on 5 people chances are one of these will be in your match queue

Stop

Wait one hour

Swipe right on 5 yay you got another match

Stop wait one hour

Repeat until your match queue is empty

All of these steps work on pc where there is no limit to number of daily swipes It is currently unknown whether this works for mobile But hey someone might find out",0,856

I signed up yesterday and straight away opted for incognito mode Today when my premium ended I extended it until the end of the month

So Im not really sure how to take it like youre still actively trying to date other girls Its a really nice picture too

Even more frustrating Im supposed to go on a date with this guy Weds night that was a reschedule from last week he suddenly had his daughter and when I noticed my Bumble being weird I sent him my number but just now I checked and hes gone from my chat queue It seems like he checks Bumble infrequently and Im worried that maybe he didnt get the message with my number Like is this glitch also happening on his end So if he didnt check his messages in time he never got my number and Im now no longer in his chat If so that sucks Or is he still seeing our chat I guess Ill find out come Wednesday And I would say hes unmatching me except now its multiple guys disappearing every time I open the app and that has never happened before I still had convos from guys I dated years ago in my chat This is something else This happen to anyone else

"So last year I matched with a clinical psychologist who works in private practice I was just 19 then Im 20 now On his profile it says that hes 24 years old but when I pointed out that he seems pretty young to be a clinical psychologist he said hes actually 26 However I found out months later that he was actually 28 around that time Now I still see him on dating apps and he seems to be making new profiles often  sometimes admitting his real age 29 sometimes still pretending to be 24 

And heres where the plot thickens Two years ago a friend of mine used to rant to me about a certain teacher of hers who has a relationship with one of her classmates The said classmate is just 16 years old that time while the teacher is already 26 And tell you what I found out that that said teacher is the same person as the shrink I met on bumble I confronted him about it when we were still talking and he said that both the school admin and the girls parents knew about their relationship which seems fishy to me tbh

I dont want to assume things but given his past it seems like he pretends to be younger on dating apps to get younger girls Is it likely that hes a groomer then And if so I find it disturbing that somebody like him works as a therapist and Im scared he might victimized other young girls on dating apps especially given his knowledge on psychology When we were still talking he was so good at flirting and seduction he instantly made me fall for him",0,1461

Hope youre all well I want some feedback on someone I matched with so she swiped right first and then I did the same and the amount of time in between when we talk is like once a day the match has a part time job and post graduate studies which are understandably time consuming on their part

But our messages are engaging with a lot of effort in responses and back and forth questions It was only until yesterday that she hasnt got back to me yet I said something like if I surprise you one day at work will you charge me with the cup of tea I ordered as the last thing I said Since then she hasnt got back to me yet and Im overthinking it

Half of you are on a proclaimed dating app looking for hooks ups or have I dont know in your bio Yet you expect a slew of likes Most of you are only in the sub to have another pack of incels to run with so you can blame and attack every woman that has  negative to say about her Bumble experience 

No matter how many women you swipe right on no matter how much you add to your bio no matter how many photos you use if youre still a bitter incel with a deep seeded hatred for women then no one is going to like you Its your own fault for having an unrealistic view of how women should treat you 

We dont owe any of you shit We dont owe you a response or a date or a match The world is bigger than your dating troubles No one cares Stop being such a fucking weirdo step out of your mothers basement and shave your god damn neck beard and maybe youll be more well received The world doesnt hate you you hate yourself",0,1296

"After reading a lot of posts here I get the impression of how much people hate small talks which makes me want to share what I have been dealing with 

I matched with this guy on Bumble and we have been texting NONSTOP since the first day and now its been over a month The thing is he only asks me questions like how is your dayeveningnight going or what are you up to I have no idea why on earth Im still answering those questions Maybe because he seems very nice and I dont want to look bad by ignoring him We did meet once and it was nice talking in person for sure But it was suggested by me and ended by him after a 15 hour walk in a park I woundt even consider that a date After the meet up I was a little confused since I thought maybe he wasnt interested But then we went back to the nonstop small talks He still texts me every day from good morning to sweet dreams It does feel nice when being checked on by someone and it has made me feel very accustomed to it When he doesnt text me for a while I feel anxious and would want to check on him 

So I guess my question is do you think if he is just bad at making good conversations or talking to women or could it be something else We are both 32 and kind of nerdy He plays a lot of video games and Im more like a photographymovie geek I feel the way we get to know each other is basically through sharing our daily activities and routines 

I really like him and want to get to know more about him but I just dont feel that he wants to spend time together as much as I do I have told him that if he would like to meet again he needs to ask me So now Im like waiting impatiently without knowing when hell ask me out Again Im just very confused but I dont know if I should say or do something I do not want to seem pushy or clingy for sure 

Thanks for any thoughts",0,1822

"I learned recently that you can request your data from Bumble It ended up being a pain in the ass for me took three weeks and four requests to actually get it but some of the information in there is pretty interesting

I opened my account in the city Im in in January 2020 and at this point Ive swiped on 14084 profiles and have been swiped on 16132 times

    Outgoing yes  6088
    Outgoing no   7996

"So I am a 22 year old woman and I accidentally swiped right on this one guy also 22 and we matched so I just thought Id let the match expire personally I always thought it was kinder cuz then there could be the benefit of doubt of accidentally the missing the match rather than a flatout rejection thats what I personally prefer be done to me as well if a guy doesnt like me He did end up extending the match but like I saidI just wasnt interested so I went about my day 

I noticed that even later on during the week after the extended match should have expired hed show up in my queue again Which was weird because I dont remember swiping on him again Hed also extend the match which I also just tried to let expire A few days later I notice that he found my Instagram which wasnt even linked on my profile same with my last name and he began spamming me every couple of hours basically askingpestering me with the following

Why arent you talking to me

Why do you keep rematching me and not talking I really dont remember rematching him again

Quit playing hard to get Im notIm just not interested if I wanted to talk to you I would 

Women are supposed to message first I feel like you dont know how to use Bumble 

Why do you keep ignoring me 

I also made my IG private after those messages cuz I didnt want him to be able to look at my photos And then I got a few Follow Request notifications throughout the day from him idk if he kept rescinding the request and sending it I also got a Friend Request from him on Facebook IdkIm just freaked out at howpersistent this guy is being and the how he found my social media and all Is there anything else I should do for the time being Should I be as freaked out as I am",0,1722
Ill try to sum this up as short as possible Boyfriend and I decided to be official 2 weeks ago I noticed a few days ago his account was still active on Bumble I didnt say anything because I thought maybe he had just forgotten to delete it Yesterday I looked again and noticed the location updated to the airport So Im assuming this means he is still active and looked while at the airport I then questioned him about it and he said he had it disabled obviously a lie since I found it And then he said he was going to delete it His profile vanished so I figured he deleted it but he was also in the new city at this point so maybe he just opened it and that was it I decided today to pay for travel mode and put my city as the city hes currently in and found his profile It wasnt in travel mode it was just as if he lived there I confronted him about it and he said he hasnt opened the app once Someone please make sense of this Is there any possible way he hasnt been using it or am I correct,0,992

"I have had Bumble for approximately a month now and am deleting it in the next few days because it has been horrible for my selfesteem So far I have swiped right on hundreds of women and have had two matches The first of these was so far as I can tell a bot The second was an actual person who ghosted me one day before our arranged date 

This is just the tip of the iceberg of the issues While the scant number of matches I have got is demoralising what is even more saddening is the way in which women and presumably men seem to sift through profiles I have taken quite a bit of time to make my bio as witty and detailed as possible with the expectation that since Bumble is primarily an app to find a relationship rather than a hookup people would put store on this I have a great degree from a world famous university and an interesting and impressive job too 

However it appears people are swiping almost exclusively on photos At this point I should point out that my photos are not shocking and add that I am a decent looking guy But I am bald and by no means a pinup Its difficult to not draw the conclusion that this makes online dating all but impossible 

So the upshot is Im deleting my account Good luck to everyone still on it but for the reasons just outlined Bumble wasnt for me Im hoping to have more luck with encounters inperson",0,1348

"I am always happy to message first and I always start with an interesting  question based on their profile depending on how interesting their profile is The conversation rolls well as long as I am the one keeping it rolling by asking questions I think asking questions is CRUCIAL to showing and maintaining interest this probably mainly applies to people who have stated theyre looking for a relationship 

Me Hi X you like Sunday breakfast Cooking at home or dining out
Match Dining our for sure 
gtgtgt Im out gtgtgt unmatch

Sorry not sorry 

If people are baffled by why others unmatch after the first message this could be why Man or woman dont expect the other person to constantly carry the conversation This is evident in the first 23 exchanges It makes you appear lacklustre mediocre boring and if you were actually interested you arent able to show it the other person is certainly not interested anymore 

Furthermore when someone does this after several messages back and forth its a red flag Theyre not interested in YOU or your needs theyre interested in themselves only and what they can get out of you with nothing on offer in return

"Hi I have been trying to make friendships on Bumble BFF for a couple of months now and have nothing but odd experiences which has kind of made me question myself

I live in a big predominantly liberal city so finding people who are accepting about my gender identity and sexuality isnt the issue here Its just the people I do match with just treat me so weirdly I wish I had a better word to describe it but Ill add some examples One example is of a girl who I matched with who seemed really cool She seemed a bit shy but we texted a lot about anime and stuff that we liked We had plans to meet up downtown but she cancelled an hour before because of her anxiety I thought this was fine but I tried rescheduling a couple of weeks later and she left me on read Eventually we did reschedule because she did text me back a couple days after she hat and apologized for leaving me on read because she has been busy but she then cancelled again She went on a big spiel about how shes been socially anxious lately I told her it was fine but I never texted her back after that But then on her Instagram story a couple days later she made a post about how shes meeting up with someone from BFF that day and how she was excited about it This upset me so I just decided to unfollow her and then I saw that she had blocked me after I unfollowed her

Another example I meet a girl on BFF a couple months ago and she seems really cool We text a lot about common interests and things like that She wasnt super comfortable hanging out with people because she wasnt vaccinated yet but we did text sometimes She is also a jeweler so  I commissioned her for a pair of custom earrings She said we could do a social distanced drop off so we did but I thought the interaction was going to be quick because I had work but she actually ended up talking to me for a while She even said that she wanted to hang out with me as soon as she got her last dose of Moderna and that I was cool This made me feel happy and a few weeks later she posted on her story Im fully vaccinated now HMU if you want hang and so was I so I replied to her story saying I was She just left me on read but posted other responses from people who replied to her story question which I thought was weird She hasnt replied to me since

Lastly I matched with a person who seemed really cool We would call sometimes and even hung out once which was super fun But then they moved away for college and we kind of lost touch They then made a Twitter post saying that they want to become pen pals with someone from our city so I sent them a message saying that we should try it out They then made up an excuse saying that I lived too far and postage would be expensive which I knew was a lie so I left them on read An hour later they just sent me the shrug shoulders emoji which was odd

Everyone else who I have matched with on BFF have either been very dry with messages or just never responds to my first message it makes me wonder if Im the problem here",0,2998

What if you go on a date and its all ok maybe you meet for a drink and theyre attractive enough but you dont get a strong feeling or connection and convo is slow or whatever but theyre trying as hard as you But you dont feel like youll meet again And you realize you just met them out of boredom and assume they did too and dont know what they want or what they saw in you

Anyhow cue long text back from him asking if the other guy knows am I just looking for a fwb or relationship and that he feels like I scammed him the other night I explained that I generally like to interact with someone more first before knowing if I want to date them because I straight up dont know them yet but he countered by saying the other guy and I already agreed to date

"Hi Everyone 

I had a 25 year come to an abrupt end due to catching my now exgirlfriend cheating on me earlier this year It was one of the most painful experiences of my life and I was left very hurt After taking time to heal I downloaded Bumble on a whim to see if I could meet someone new and possibly try to find love again I had used Bumble with some success in 2018 and was excited to see the app and what had changed What happened next astounded me 

I paid for the premium service and within a couple of hours my Beeline was filling up fast Ive never done great at dating apps but Ive never done terribly either I was shocked at how many authentic people I was talking with and setting up times to grab a drink I went on a few dates some went better than others but none of them went poorly I even made a new friend to go to concerts with whenever those return My confidence that had been so damaged by my previous relationship started coming back and I felt good about myself My mental health greatly benefitted from this too and I even spoke to my therapist about how much Bumble was doing for me as an individual Then on Monday I woke up to a message notification I had gotten overnight I opened it but it took me to the login screen of the app Nothing would work my password face ID nothing I opened up my laptop and tried to login on their webpage When I typed in my verification code I was told I had been banned due to complaints about my behavior This shook my world I submitted support tickets via email and sent them a brief explanation vie DM on Twitter too As of this post I still havent heard a single thing back from their support team

I have never once sent a message that would make someone uncomfortable in any way shape or form Im not some young guy just going on to try and convince girls to sleep with me I was honest kind and empathetic One of my prompt question answers What trait do you look for in a partner was literally empathy I had not  and still have not sent a message that would be rude My profile broke none of the terms or service or bumble rules They were all MY photos of me and my face was visible in all of them I could understand being banned if I had sent aggressive messages or had demonstrated behavior which could have made people uncomfortable but I literally have not done anything wrong on the app I know these claims are from some random internet guy but I hope you can take me for my word I wouldnt be sitting here writing this just to go back and be a bad person to people

So I lost dates with a couple of girls and they probably think that Im a crappy person now because my profile vanished That sucked I then logged in with my Facebook account and realized that I could use Bumble again because that account wasnt tied to my Apple ID I took the time to update that old profile I had from 2018 and replace it with what my banned profile looked like and then boom I was finding some of the same girls and trying to explain what had happened They all thought is was weird too Things went well again for two days until this morning when I woke up unable to access my account again Im assuming its banned I cannot begin to tell you how frustrated I am The fact that I acted with kindness and integrity and that things were going so well just makes this all the more strange 

Heres the tough part Im supposed to go on a date with a great girl tonight but now that I dont have access to my account I cant talk to her We had the time and the place picked out but we all know how plans can change I had plans with a few other girls next week too and now I have no way of ever speaking to them again 

I have no idea why I am being banned and Ive thought about it A LOT Could my ex and her friends be submitting complaints to get me banned Maybe but I dont think so Could my account or location be getting flagged due to using my companys wifi while at work Its a VPN routed through our offices in Austin Could my profile be getting reported as fake due to grainy photos I had to crop my ex out of some of them so the resolution isnt perfect 

I just dont know why this keeps happening I matched with a girl the night before I got banned and we actually exchanged numbers She turned out to be pretty aggressive she was drinking that night which I think contributed to that and I ended up saying goodnight to her after refusing to go meet up with her at a bar at midnight on a work night Her name was Kailey Maybe she got angry and reported me out of spite 

I really need the communitys help with this As someone who pays for this service this whole situation irks me even more To be banned permanently with no warning nor discussion is not very ethical in my eyes I had a chance to meet some really cool people over the next week and I need Bumble to take an actual look at what has happened to my profile I had used the service years ago with no problem whatsoever

Please upvote this post I know there is someone who works for Bumble on this subreddit and I really need their help to get this escalated and reviewed so I can have a chance at making my date tonight at 6PM MST Id ask for a real review of my bans and what led to them because something strange is going on here If you made it this far thank you so so much for your time and your help I hope you all have a good day and best of luck on Bumble",0,5359
After a period away from dating Ive just started online dating on Bumble As I suspect is typical for many men I must have swiped right on maybe 300 women before I got a match but it happened And she seemed nice Attractive really wholesome and we seemed to have a lot in common we hit it off chatting and I asked her out for later this week and  joy of joys  she said yes It would have been my first date in a few years and I was really excited for it took the time to plan out a really bespoke meet based around our mutual interests in Thai food and history You can guess what happened Fast forward to a few days before were due to meet and theyve unmatched me Poof Gone without any kind of explanation Why do people do this Its just so bizarre Not only did it come completely out of the blue  wed been chatting everyday and seemed to get on well  but it would have taken them all of 5 seconds just to politely explain that theyd met someone else that they didnt think we had as much in common as shed first thought or any other reason that shed gone off me Why do people do this Is this a pretty common experience for Bumble users,0,1131

I just really feel very little motivation to swipe on a guy that cares nothing about filling out his profile because it gives me NOTHING to start a conversation and if they dont feel like putting the effort into their profiles my guess is they wont put any effort into a conversation either Theyre clearly expecting for swipes based on their looks but this is a little disappointing for me because that means probably only swiped right on me for the same reason and not because they actually found anything interesting in my profile

"This applies to all dating apps to some extent but especially ones like Bumble that present few barriers to signing up and few restrictions on choice  The constant barrage of choice is meant to keep you wanting more Theres a reason they dont show you how many other users everyone else is talking to because that would show the real the house odds and kill the illusion that every swipe could be the one This is not how an honest an transparent market works its how casinos hook gamblers 

All this is not to say that you cant find happiness in OLD but those of you who do arent who theyre designing these fancy features for Some people win 100 at the slots and walk away happy but its the ones who sit there day after day like zombies hoping against hope that make the bottom line

The last year was kind of rough for me 4 of my 5 best guy friends became dads over the last year and a half so Ive spent the majority of the last year alone I lost 85lbs during that time I only have four photos of me where Im not fat and not with my ex so those are what went on my Bumble profile I think they are 4 really wellrounded pics and each kind of gives you a window into what I really enjoy doing in life In addition to that I put great thought into my the word choices tags and answers to questions to try and provide as many potential ice breaking points as possible for any woman who decides to swipe right on me 

My beeline has 38 women queued up but Ive only matched with 6 so far 5 of the 6 have all started with the exact same Hi How are you or Hi Hows it going Are these bots I really wish this wasnt how all conversations were being started Its even worse when its coming from someone with a profile with very little info and it makes it really hard to get a conversation going It almost feels like an interview more than a conversation

"Water is the equivalent to matches and attention

Most men are dehydrating and in search of this water Women on the other hand are flooded with water but its polluted water In other words most women get tons of matches and messages but mostly it is from rude and disrespectful men The women basically begin drowning in this polluted water Meanwhile the men see the women drowning in water not knowing that its polluted and just see them having an over abundance of water

"About me Im a 24 year old man studying as a postgraduate at uni Before Covid when I met a woman that I liked at a party or so and asked for a date I was like 3040 successful most of the unsuccessful times when she had a bf What Im trying to say is I wasnt particularly unlucky with women sometimes quite the opposite I had dates with amazing women

My profile I have some professionally taken photos I think some creative prompt answers and put effort into my profile to make it look good I dont have any photos with expensive cars leather jacket pretentious photos in suits Im just myself I really dont want to sound pretentious but I actually think this profile doesnt make a bad impression and that I have a sense for what photos look good etc

The reality Im swiping every other day and have the app installed for 2 months now 5 likes in the first few days after that Nothing Not a single woman liked me Not a single woman messaged me The absolute same situation on Hinge 

My question What is wrong with this platform I live in London probably hundreds of thousands of women use the app there I even purchased this thing where it promotes your profile Really no like Not even one There must be at least one out of the thousands and thousands of women who thinks Hmm he looks nice If I hadnt had this experiences before I probably would be extremely depressed and sad I kind of am anyways

My guess 

A The type of women that I fancy typically doesnt use platforms like Hinge or Bumble

gt Maybe but that doesnt explain the ZERO likes

B Hinge and Bumble are platforms that squeeze people for money especially men that feel lonely or desperately want a woman on their side They exploit these people with ridiculously high prices and have thrown their moral compass overboard They make it seem like it is realistic for men to find somebody when many of the female profiles are fake or not active and the male to female ratio is ridiculously high

"SoI did it  
I gave up resisting and jumped back on dating apps used different ones in the past but decided to go with Bumble cos I kinda like the fact that women can control how many men they have trying to get their attentions  
So heres my findings and some humble advice and troubleshooting tips my apologies if youve heard it all before but some wont have and bumble isnt entirely transparent about a few things  
For reference I am a male a dad whose daughter lives with her mother but I see regularly and a dndgaming nerd I live in a village with plenty of nearby towns in the UK so not exactly prime real estate but not too bad Im also not totally unattractive but definitely not anyones go to for a modelapart from my gay best friend but you know

 I used premium for 1 week I know some people think its stupid but it worked for me meant I could see who had liked me and not have to just hope those people came up during my swiping

 I was very selective about who I swiped on my criteria was simpleIf I cant think of something interesting to open with something we have shared interest in I wont swipe right Stopped me burning out having a load of boring chats I suspect Bumble may adjust its algorithms based on who you swipe on to make matches more likely And lets be fair some profiles pictures are a lot of fun to browse but if they aint got content Im not wasting my time If I just want a hottie Ill go to tinder for my disappointment thanks

 I in my first 2 days got 9 matches and 7 of them were a full conversation one never replied past the first message one I actually said sorry I have too many conversations I have limited bandwith for sociability 6 full conversations are enough Some did open with hi and a smiley face but because I only swiped on people I was actually interested in I could open a conversation with every single one Some started with proper conversation openers Now one ghosted as soon as I talked about my daughter which Im okay with but Id rather a goodbye message Of the 6 remaining 3 I have first meetups with over these few days and have exchanged numbers and 3 more are slower repliers but are giving me lengthy messages so I dont mind at all

 Now to some maybe that sounds terrible but for me in one week having 6 ongoing conversations with 6 gorgeous women all of whom I have something in common with all of whom I could see myself spending the rest of my life withthats a pretty good week

Soin my week of fun I learnt few things about the bumble app that isnt well explainedif Ive misunderstood please correct me below

1 If you get a notification saying you have people that swiped right on you but none show up in the app on premium it wont show them if your filters are set to exclude them  up the distance and age range and turn off verified only and they all showed up for meBUT when I ended premium today suddenly I had loads of likes waiting but obviously couldnt see who they were  
CONCLUSION  When new or downgrading from premium Bumble will give you priority on the swiping list and make it clear you have loads of people waiting regardless of your filterswhen on premium it will respect your filters for likes as well as swiping

2 Bumble is rubbish at notificationsIve opened the app to find someone messaged me back hours ago never assume you dont have a message its always worth double checking 

3 Dont open with a dick picplease dontI know a very small minority of women will be into it but I have been told by one of them that I was the first guy she was attracted to that hadnt sent her one as an opener Please guys at least see if she gets flirty first And just in case you think its a prudish thing one of these girls has told me many unspeakable things she wants to do to me when we do meet

I could go on but a lot of stuff is just general OLD advice  
Obviously if I just did bumble free maybe Id have had the same experience but if I spent 15 and end up on even a few good datesIm gonna say worth it  


TLDR Bumble seems to have worked for me because I paid for a week was selective about swiping and wasnt a dumbass So if youre not sure I would try it for a week

Good luck my friends and may the algorithm bless you",0,4195
"Like if it could be a setting Only I can make the first move and you check yes or no and if you check no the guys are able to make the first move as well That way women who actually enjoy this can continue to do it

I matched with a guy back in Feb and we hit it off great We texted a ton and had good conversation However we were finally going to meet up after a few weeks of talking and he bailed and then ghosted me 

Now its been about 2 months since that happened and he texted me out of the blue on Thursday and apologized for what he had done and that I deserved better We went on a date on Friday and it went super well We were together for like 56 hrs and he made multiple comments about seeing me again We laughed a ton it was obviously a little awkward because we were meeting for the first time but it was also very comfortable and almost felt like we werent strangers at all

Yesterday he sent me three texts all day  hed say something and just vanish for hours Same with today one text this morning and then silence 

Maybe Im reading into it too much but to me that shows hes really not interested in me though his text this morning was asking me basically about what we could do together again When we were on said first date he checked his phone once or twice so I dont think hes the type to be totally detached from his phone I dunno just looking for some insight not shitty comments about if Im overthinking I dont expect him to text me 247 of course but why text me to just not respond",0,1379

"Checked the app this morning and was greeted with a message telling me Ive been blocked from the platform  Cue me trying to remember if I said anything that would warrant this nope

I had a few ongoing conversations with girls on there that were going fine which I now lost obviously and besides that I had some expired chats because I really forget to check this app for days at a time  Truthfully cant think of a single reason someone would have reported me unless they were just being petty because I didnt reply  I really dont know  Ive never argued with anybody on this app if the conversation is going in a negative direction I just unmatch  Has anybody else encountered this problem

On another note I deleted the app reinstalled it then selected the Sign in with Facebook option I usually just sign in with my Apple ID and it allowed me to create and verify a new account  Of course I lost all my chats which is a bummer but such is life",0,945

"Ive just gotten back into the world of online dating again and the title is the reason why Im always reluctant to switch from the app to WhatsApp The men will often initiate the switch by offering their number

Recently I sent this guy a message on WhatsApp which he acknowledged I replied and that was it He left me on two grey ticks not even the dignity of being left on read We seemed to be getting on well and he asked me plenty of questions about myself before this on the app

Im guessing he didnt like the way my WhatsApp profile picture looked I think I look quite nice in it I cant think of any other reason Men of Reddit please help explain why this happens and if there is anything I can do to avoid this happening again Im trying to avoid my phonebook turning into insert name Bumble Thank you x",0,807
This is the only dating app Ive used where Ive accidentally swiped left multiple times because of crappy design I scroll one handed using my left thumb which naturally pulls a tad to left when swiping up to scroll down and the app often recognizes this slight pull to the left as a left swipe I dont have this issue on Tinder or Hinge Apparently the designers of those apps recognized that a lot of people use there thumbs to scroll lol I would have less of an issue with this if the app didnt charge for its rewind feature which makes we wonder if its purposely designed this way,0,580
"Hi I want to start dating women online 

I dont know much about Bumble and would love to give it a try 

About me

In the past I was always rejected for being labeled as a weirdo due to my ethnicity People were absolute aholes and it made cringe to the point of giving up on people It made me close myself up as I grew older 

I did finished college and got both my bachelors and masters I invested time in improving myself to reach my career goals instead of wasting it on people

Now I know I dont look like Chris Hemsworth or what have you but Im not the worst looking guy in the world either How the fuck is it I cant get one single match in a week on here Its very demoralizing lol and quite frustrating Any tips on pictureprofile choices to get more likes Ive tried spotlight and shit but nothing

"In a pathetic attempt to make friends I downloaded Bumble bff and man is this bleak has anyone had any actual luck forming friendships I am a female seeking other female friendships and find myself swiping right when i come across a profile who has similar interests to mine but i feel like some girls might be swiping based on looks and what fits their aesthetic

Ive had quite a few guys extend the match immediately like way before 24 hours has passed and then when I message them they dont respond Whats up with that I always message more than hey or hi and comment on something in their profile or ask a question so its not that theres not much to respond to Whats the deal,0,313

" You have little to no photos that clearly show your face Sunglasses hat hair in face etc 

 Youre making goofy faces in your photos Ive never understood why men do this to me it doesnt make them look attractive it just makes me feel like theyre insecure Thats just me though 

 You only have group photos Im not playing Wheres Waldo for a guy who provably wont even message me back 

 Your photos are mostly with women who dont look like family members If youre a player more power to you but Im not into that Its one thing to have friends who are women but I wouldnt want to date a guy whos ONLY friends with women 

 You didnt have your profile filled out completely If you answered two of the lifestyle questions just put your snap in your bio and didnt fill out any prompts what do you expect me to start a conversation about If you have so little to say about yourself how can you expect anyone to take interest

 Your pictures are inconsistent I dont wanna play Russian Roulette and hope that Ill get the best version out of 35 photos that look like slightly different people 

 All your photos look like theyre out of a magazine Im realistic with my swipes Most guys that have their profile set up like a modeling portfolio are just on there for attention in my experience 

 Copy Paste bios Is there like a book of bios that men use or something I get copypaste bios are common among both men and women but it still warrants a left swipe Its unoriginal and boring Id rather hear about YOU and not what a dozen other men have put in their bio",0,1550
"So 27M here set up my profile last week you can actually find it in the weekly advice thread if there is enough interest Ill link it here So far I havent had a single match yet and the only 2 likes I got the first day disappeared in the following 48h I actually only reached the max allowed swipes on the first day and I spent 2 hours checking profiles age range set to 2332 Some of the considerations I take when browsing profiles I occasionally make exceptions to these

 First of all and probably my most crippling issue is language Im living abroad in a country with 2 official languages quite segreggated and I can barely speak one of them Fortunately Im living in the capital where there us a high concentration of international residents and often prompts and bios are partially in English or have nouns I understand I do try to translate the bio and prompts when I find the girl interesting or there are words I recognize but when combined with considerations below sometimes I cant be bothered

 Distance is also an issue because apparently the userbase in my country is too small to set a max radius If the girl is 50 kilometres from me I really have to like her profile a girl being cure without further 

 If the profile is snoozed no distance appearing I dont bother Shes either not using the app at the time or has snoozed because shes overwhelmed by messagesis in a more serious conversation with a match

 If the profile is only pictures or the bioprompts are single wordstoo genericonly emojis thats a no from me Im not necessarily looking for a stable relationship but Id like to have something to talk about if we match I know Im not attractive enough to get girls solely on looks nor good enough with pickup lines and small talk to seduce anyone

 I do sometimes go for Horny swipes basically if the girl is so beautifulhot that other considerations can be overlooked or simply there is not info on the bio other than they are active and relatively close  However I rarely do this more than 23 profiles a day

Considering that I reach the no more profiles almost always that I browse should I change my strategy
If I left swipe a girl before she sees my profile does it mean that even if she swipes right on me afterwards I wont get the like notification because I already rejected her If that is the case maybe it would be better to wait a few days and see if I get some likes and then risk with swiping or paying for a single day premium to see the profiles",0,2479
"Ok Im a little suspicious about beeline as Ive noticed a strange pattern  


Everyonelike 5 women who has been in my beeline is from 50 miles away where as the two people who liked me after I liked them are all as I would expect people who see me to be close by  


I cant image me being near the front of the stack when these people widen their search restraints whats up with this Ive never actually heard from any of these beeline likes though most of them I didnt match with Ive matched with one because I was curious and they never said anything

"  During the thick of exam period I was exhausted underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time jaded and bored The past few weeks had been very unexciting I just cycling through the same routine of waking up eating working sleeping I just focused entirely on the rote mechanics of doing rather than you know being and was just SO fucking bored as a result Between study sessions my friend suggested that I download dating apps for a bit of excitement and some external validation I agreed deciding that a cheap dopamine hit would feel good in the endless monotony I downloaded it set up the profile in a half assed manner and began messaging a few guys that I matched with One of them was particularly interesting 

He had a prompt on his profile that I responded to well get along if you like talking about random hypothetical scenarios and so we began a discussion about kindergarteners sumo suits and a zombie apocalypse Many hours later we began to talk about career goals familial relationships and our peacemaking tendencies social ettiquette our mutual dislike for hosting parties our mutual love and affection for cats and our frustration with people who dont return their trollies to the coralle Its mad rude We talked for at least 6 consecutive hours The conversation was immaculate He was funny and smart and SO cool I had not felt real feelings in so long and was ashamed and found it bizarre that I was suddenly developing feelings for a guy I had never met and only spoken to on text My intention when downloading the app truthfully was just to see how many guys found me attractive and would hit on me Yes I know how problematic that sounds I was planning to delete the app and my account a few hours later because I wasnt actually looking for anything and had a paralysing fear that someone particularly a judgemental family member would find my profile But Jesus Christ I could not stop talking to this guy I had a major essay due in three days that I needed to work on and exams straight after But I could not stop checking my phone And I hated it

Its so contrary to my being and my general identity which is so nerdy and organised and focused to not study because I cannot stop thinking about a guy It feels to me almost unfeminist to let a boy get in the way of my education in any no matter how minute way But more than that there were other issues too He was white and he was in police academy though he did acknowledge police brutality and all but I am fervently vehemently anti police altogether And not keen on white boys generally either Then there are all the other religious and cultural concerns and baggage that I dont even want to begin to address But it is just so tempting so tempting to pursue a relationship with this guy He truly seems like such a sweet wonderful person and a good partner He is smart in the way that I think I need and the way that always imbues conversation with a certain depth and authenticity He is caring and intuitive and emotionally intelligent in the way that I think matches me He makes me feel a selfaffection I can already vividly and clearly see myself with him and can completely imagine falling in love with him And I dont feel this way often Or like ever 

The thought of being with him genuinely makes me feel warm inside And holy fuck I was not expecting for this shit to happen so randomly Pls share your thoughts because I am confused shocked and racked with guilt because I am here writing this rant instead of doing all the work that I really should be doing",0,3535

I get that this sounds dumb but wondering if anyone has experienced this  if youve unmatched because of feeling overwhelmed I feel so bad thinking about doing it  awkward but seeking any advice",0,665
So as a guy I never receive super swipes on bumbleIm guessing most women dont pay for them but the strangest thing happened tonight I received a super swipe so decided to match with her Now I check 20 mins or so later and the match is gone meaning she unmatched with me without even messaging me m Im confused here Has this ever happened to anyone else,0,352
"Hi all
So I matched with a girl who was new to bumble and straight of the bat she was genuine and asked questions and even said were quite compatible Unlike a lot of other matches that make you do all the work and then waste your time We were only chatting for 4days and I havent received a reply in 2days She only seemed to message between 8pm and 9pm Do I send a follow up message to see if this going to go anywhere Im really quite interested in her and she does seem to get busy with work being a nurse

Ps Its so frustrating when you match with someone that looks and seems so genuine instead of someone that seems to good to be true only to find that youd still get ghosted or they cant even hold a conversation",0,717

Ive felt like Im in a perpetual nightmare thinking about it over and over again weeks later

Fuck I wish I never wouldve told her what I did to make her want to split up Me and my BIG MOUTH get it From the awesome netflix series Yeah bad joke Im just trying to make myself smile again Anyway

I messaged her a week after she said we should stop talking and got the same response I told her I missed talking to her and if we could try again and see where it goesshe said itll be better if we just deleted each other numbers 

Ive been crying about this but its all good I need this I dont want to be a stranger to my emotions I want to learn them

Its just hard to let her go even though I know its over I know theres other fish in the sea but damnit Why even date anymore if it always causes heartache

So now that Im back home the only way I can seem to continue to see local profiles is keep setting my  profile to traveling  If I try to tell it Im back home it sets my location as the beach spot  Is there a way to permanently set or am I forever stuck with the beach as my home because thats where I created my profile",0,723

So that leaves me with the other two ladies I was talking to I dont think it would be fair at this point to continue our conversations as it feels like Id be leading them on Plus wouldnt feel right towards the person Im now dating for obvious reasons

I dont really want to just ghost them as that could leave them wondering what they did wrong honestly nothing just had a strong connection with a particular person but kind of feel sending a message explaining it might also not be great for them because honestly however I spin it its still rejection

On Saturday night I matched with this very pretty woman who was my age mid30s and we began chatting We were chatting about what kind of messages women like to get on bumble and she brought up dick pics She said she hated unsolicited ones but liked them if they were from the right guy I told her I had never sent a dick pic before and she replied well this might be a good time for your first I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didnt matter and she wouldnt judge So I stood in front of the mirror pulled my pants and underwear down and took one I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible I sent it and nervously waited for a reply I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic It was of her with 3 other women each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the small peen hand sign It looked like they were at a bar and they were laughing I was so devastated I wrote back and said how could you do this to me and then she sent a pic of the four of them with their pants pulled down and they were mooning I immediately unmatched her I trusted her and she totally humiliated me Is this how women usually act on bumble I though it would be a positive experience but it has turned out to be very negative,0,1313

I have no idea what happened or what I could have done to get myself banned I dont know if I was getting ghosted too hard so bumble said Well put this guy out of his misery and just ban him or what but seeking answers from bumble support seems to be futile I asked both on twitter and facebook support accounts what happened to my account but as soon as I give them my phone number I stop getting responses

Theres a few nice guys Im chatting to that have given me the impression that Im the only girl theyre talking to and I dont want to lead them on to think that Im doing the same when Im actively talking to a fair number I dont personally see the point of only talking to one person because I want to get to know multiple and I feel like after a certain amount of time you can sus out the ones you genuinely get on with 

Does this make me a bad person",0,491
"I matched with this girl last week and we hit it off immediately Shes super woke knows a ton about my culture is into the same taste wrt culture and arts and the conversations have simply been gliding along since and we agreed to meet next weekend 

I was stalking her Instagram yesterday largely out of appreciation for her aesthetic and came across a reel that sort of alerted me to the fact I found her Twitter next inactive since 2018where it became clear that she had transitioned that year 

This doesnt change my feelings for her as a person It must be incredibly hard as it is in the space for someone whos probably had difficulties in life precisely because of this but I dont want to misrepresent my intentions Truth is Im simply not attracted to her physically  and I hadnt seen past her photos before so I couldnt have judged enough I still think shed be a cool person to hang out with and get to know but I cant really position myself in terms of how to proceed from here  and I dont want to mislead or create the wrong impression She hasnt mentioned it yet nor even alluded it to it in anyway so I dont know how it reflects on me to have stumbled upon this on my own especially from Twitter graveyard Im glad I did though because otherwise my surprise on our first meeting wouldve seemed unnaturally suppressed  at least now Im prepared 

Any advice on how to confront the situation have a dignified conversation about it I would feel disrespectful calling off the date out of nowhere but I also want to clear the air so as to keep any chance at a friendship",0,1572

"I just had an amazing first date with this woman i talked to on bumble we vibed well and laughed and had a great time ofc there was major amounts of flirting and touching we even cuddled in the car which led to making out for a couple minutes before having to go as it was getting late at night I drive home a total of 40 miles around 12 am i text her good night and that ill text soon i get no response i look at bumble to find out i was unmatched and i was my number was blocked 

Mind you that i took her out after half a week of constant flirting and play over the phone and connection it was not rushed I was planning a second date too

"Hi All

Bumble Premium gave me a free trial so I tried it out for a couple of weeks Im an Asian Male in my late20s living in a major metro area and rarely get any results on dating apps outside of other Asian women While I know Im not super goodlooking I feel like Im also not hideously unattractive aside from being really short 57 for reference because I have had decent results IRL Again nothing out of the ordinary but aboveaverage looking women have shownreciprocated interest in me whereas online I get maybe 2 swipesweek and rarely get any matches let alone ones that dont expire without a convo

As Im sure you all know Bumble Premium has a travel mode feature that lets you try out different cities around the world Well I gave this a try in various different cities and saw noticeably different results Lets set aside Asian cities like Shanghai Beijing etc where I was regularly getting at least a couple of matches amp messages per day for a moment since I am Asian Even in cities where I still am a minority like in Moscow London Rio De Janiero and am being advertised by Bumble as being in Travel Mode aka thousands of miles away I got a fair amount of swipes in my beeline and got matches  messages from much more attractive women than I match with in the US I dont think its purely socioeconomics either because a lot of the women I matched with were lawyers doctors finance professionals etc themselves

So my question is has anyone else experienced something similar and why is this the case Are Asians really that much worse off online in America and if so why is it less of a big deal in other similar European countries",0,1639

It sort of reminded me of how a YouTuber I watch tells this story of how he felt sorry for a fat girl who was getting no attention then decided to dance with her but then she gave him attitude like he wasnt good enough

"Hello

Im a developer from an Asian country and planning to create a siteapp for us average people to date Ive experienced and read about all the issues we face on current dating apps So If Im planning to develop an app with following features

1 You can add photos from the gallery But have to add a photo taken from CameraSo well be seeing the real person not just the best photo of them

2 No bs long texts in profile description Maybe a 20 character string for simplicity 

3 If you match with someone you get a second prompt to start a chat or unmatch The other person will be notified of the match only after you initiate the chat

4 You cant initiate a chat with a single character   or single emoji Minimum of 2 characters required 

5 The replying party get a 72 hour window to reply back or they get a penalty If the first chat is abusive they can use the report function to skip getting a penalty Report will be inspected by admins 

6 After 3 penalties you get blocked for a week

7 In a conversation either one can report if other person is just wasting their time and admins can monitor the chat to take a suitable actioni know this is a privacy issue but suggest a better way

8 You cant send photos over the app Theres an option to share the phone number 

9 You can filter only using sexage and distance

10 List of people who have liked you will not be hidden behind a paywall monetizing need to be done in some other way maybe later

Please provide your opinion towards this Will it grab any attention Or does this make no sense

Now my questions

A Trying to get matches without spending money or deleting and starting your profile new is nearly impossible as i WILL NOT put up pictures of my once in a year vacation on a beach or the one sport car i once saw in a street and took a pic in front of it  
Is it just me or do you normal guys out there also have the same issue  


B If i get a match Why the fuck would a girl not answer within 24 h Its not that Im that desperate maybe a little bit but you already swiped right GirlMan up and at least write something like Yo bro Im currently busy as hell brb Or whatever OR mismatch me Everything is better than letting me stare at that interesting profile and dreaming of all those funny moments we could have together and what epic response i will write after your hi

C Should i look at it as if it was just a game or hobby Today a match suddenly disappeared and i got really really sad and disappointed I didnt even knew her but it felt not good You know the feeling when you see a beautiful girl in a bar and make eye contact That moment you realize it is the exact amount of time that it was not just eye contact and not that creepy staring Isnt a match basically that moment God how i miss eye contact in bars",0,1824

I went on three dates with a guy within a week All went great he seemed very obviously interested he initiated all three All were lowkey day time coffeewalking dogs kind of dates He ended the third one with a kiss and was talking like it was a given that we would be seeing each other again in the near future I thought it was my turn to initiate so I suggested catching up on one of our next days off work He said he was busy but suggested maybe another day That day came and went  nothing I asked if he was still free and he said hed been called into work that day but hadnt contacted me to tell me until I messaged him to ask His messages started to become less frequent 

It seems clear to me that hes not interested and slow faded But the thing is I blatantly asked him in a message if he was keen to catch up again and he replied Im keen He said he had a lot on with work I said I understood and to just let me know when he was free Another few days of silence decided to give it one last shot It came to another day he had suggested he may be free to catch up I messaged and said I had a few hours free in the afternoon if he wanted to catch up He said he was busy but also replied with multiple chatty engaging questions and seemed to be initiating an ongoing conversation And then he sent another message specifically asking what my work schedule was for the rest of the week That was four days ago and Ive heard nothing more from him I wrote back a chatty response answered his various questions told him my schedule and when I was free and he didnt reply and I havent heard from him since 

I think its clear hes not interested Its just frustrating and disappointing Im a pretty clear communicator and I like direct answers I asked him if he was keen and he said Im keen and asked my work schedule Why ask that then immediately ghost I dont know if Im calling it too soon its only been a few days but this is the same guy who messaged constantly and initiated seeing me three times in that first week I should just give up on hearing from him again now right",0,2194

"Whats with Bumble threatening to ban people Ive been on it for 5 years and spent so much money on this garbage app  

Hello

Recreating multiple accounts 43 in your case to date can negatively impact you and the users around you Users are less likely to swipe right on someone they see multiple times because they think that they are experiencing a technical issue which will in turn reduce the matches you receive

This behaviour can be disruptive to our other users and our community as a whole Unfortunately if this continues to happen we may be forced to block your account Therefore we would suggest in future if you are having issues with matches that you contact us directly",0,681

"Whether a guy realizes it or not pressuringrepeatedly asking a girl for sex touching a girl inappropriately when she never consented to it Im talking butt and boob grabbing and making unwanted sexual comments even when its known that theyre not wanted is sexual harassment and sexual assault

There are many women who have been sexually assaulted abused rapedyou name it Whether we are wearing a nuns outfit or a mini skirt how we dress shouldnt be an invitation to continue if a no is spoken Little do you know we dress for ourselves and not you That should be the end of it but its not

Ive gone out on dates with guys dressed conservative and just to give an example it was jeans and a tshirt with sneakers and multiple guys still thought it was somehow fine to touch my ass or boobs without asking me or receiving a yes

"Hey everyone got broken up with a week ago and decided to make a Bumble account yesterday I got a handful of likes in my Beeline about 20 or so and then swiped through til I exhausted my chances to do so for the day without the number changing at all I have no filters on in regards to age or distance currently

Is the number like OKC where it doesnt go down unless you specifically match and thats why it hasnt changed Is there something else I need to do in order to theoretically see these women Thanks",0,506
When I see this in a womans bio its an instant left swipe First of all conceited much Second even if they are that mindblowingly beautiful which they often arent and a man who isnt attractive enough to have a realistic shot with them decides to swipe right just to take a chance all they have to do is swipe left Simple as that The fact that they actually put this in their bio is repulsive to me,0,396

"I was looking through my beeline today and found a guy that I really liked Good looking but not unobtainable Really good prompts and only 5 miles away from me This is one of the best profiles Ive come across but its late at night where I live so I didnt want to swipe right just yet with only 24 hours to reply I try to wait until daytime when I know most people are awake

Anyway I went scrolling through the rest of my beeline to see who else had liked me And I moved my finger to the left over his picture when I did that so I ended up disliking his profile and now he is gone I googled what to do immediately and apparently there is no way to undo this 

I tried searching for him the only way that I could by setting filters that I normally dont use but after swiping left on two guys it said that there was no one else that fit this criteria I guess it will be a while until he is recommended again if ever

Super frustrated right now Its not the first time Ive swiped left on someone on my beeline while scrolling through it either But its the first its happened with someone I was genuinely excited to talk to

Has anyone had this happened to them before How long until Bumble starts recommending people youve swiped left on",0,1232

"Ive never been a fan of online dating but I wanted to give it a try

I met an amazing woman and we had so much in common

We called each other everyday it was nice and we were always happy and smiling

One day 
I talked about my work life and  how stressful it is and me thinking I can talk to her about anything I told her all about all of my emotionshow I didnt like my job how I felt like it was changing me into someone I wasnt happy with and how I didnt want her to have to deal with that if we got into a relationship and how that would be selfish of me to keep her in a relationship when Im not happy with myself and make that her problem

She told me that she would be there to help me and we could do it as a team or just stay friends and I told her Id let her knowI wish I never said that at all

A few weeks later were doing good and she has a therapist appointment which I support but ever since I told her how I felt about my lifeshe said shes been feeling the same way and she told her therapist that

Now last night I got a call from her and I knew something was off by the way she was texting me 

I was right she called and told me that she doesnt think she can be in a relationship because shes not happy with herself and she didnt feel happy with me because of that I told her I would help her and be with her and we can work through it just like she told me but she didnt want that She wanted to do it alone

So obviously I cared about her so I was hurt but I also understand her and care deeply about her so what is a man to doI had to respect her wishes and let her go

Thanks to her Im going to see a therapist for myself and for the issues I have that way I can be a better partner to the woman of my dreams in the future 

But damn does it hurt I cant see her smile anymore I just want to see it once more but she said it would hurt too much and it wouldnt be a good thing

I want to be able to hide my profile without other people getting notified I think I am easily findable when I go out so I want to hide my profile Or sometimes I just get tired of using it and check back on the app later so I want to hide my profile But every time I unsnooze it fucking notifies everyone Why cant I have my privacy and do this whenever I want without other people knowing Why cant it be like tinder where I can just hide it easily Its such a stupid feature and if someone knows how to escape this without actually deleting my account that would be great,0,570

"I briefly tried Bumble Not sure its really for me but one thing that I found baffling is why does everyone super swipe Is it an attempt to make you feel obligated to swipe on them I thought the whole point was that you tried to both match with each other and then a clock started as a countdown to send a message with in a time window but you start swiping and get notified that the person super swiped before you even see the profile in full

Makes me immediately sign off the app because I dont know what the meaning is We havent matched yet I havent even seen the profile I ended up deactivating for now but will probably reactivate in the future an would like to understand if this is an app for me

However my account still received no attention except two likes at the very beginning right before I was moderated How can I fix this and get my account back out there or is it done for I also did a lot of swiping hoping that would help make me visible to no avail

Side note For comparison though its a different game the same profile pics amp bio on Tinder in the same day got me about 40 likes of which I matched with 18 The only thing I can think of is if they moderate me for saying Im polyamkinklgbtBLM friendlyally just like how its typed here",0,1132

"Im not that goodlooking barely average so I workout to compensate and it actually was working on bumble met some really nice girls Getting about 5 matches every week until the app filtered out my 12  shirtless pics now Im lucky if I get one a week Doesnt matter what clothes I wear or my description what causes most people to swipe right on someone is having a baseline physical attraction towards said person be that body or face or both unless youre just the type of person who purely cares about personality

I have no friends dont really want any so I cant get my pictures taken with them to showcase social adeptness Im into martial arts and I tried to posting pics and clips of me fighting but I think that actually intimidates girls I wear very plain simple clothing and  dont want to wear fancy clothes just to impress people so Im not sure how I could garner appeal that way Im not rich so I cant really showcase wealth

"OK so Ive paid for Bumble Premium sucker I know Ive got a bunch of bees lined up in my Beeline Call it the queue Some were the same as those who I had in my queue 6 months ago when I left Bumble and some are new ones So my perfect match comes up Sunday night at about 930 and I notice that shes only 4 miles away in that readout at the bottom of her profile And its a Super Like Wow my best match in like 10 years Im ecstatic Everything lines up I can tell shes local by the photos Not a scam Since its late and Ive had bourbon and I dont want to get into a sideways text convo I decide I will right swipe first thing in the morning At 7 AM Monday shes still in my queue but the mileagedistance readout is gone I assume theres something wrong with my phone because I havent used the app all night and I right swipe anyway I wait all day and hear nothing By 10 PM Im getting pissy because time is running out and I want to go to bed and stop thinking about it So I unmatch her because Im ticked that someone would send a super like and not get back to me in the 24 I really had my hopes up

So I wondered why her distance didnt show up in the morning and I Googled it I saw a comment that says when someone is in your queue and the distance is gone they have paused their profile So Im thinking she got overwhelmed and paused her profile the night she right swiped me I looked at everyone in my queue and about 75 do not have distances at the bottom of their profiles Especially the old ones from 6 months ago Today I right swiped someone in my queue who did have the distance measure and she responded fairly promptly

 So finally to my question

If someone is in your queue and you right swipe and they have paused their profile what happens Does your match just go into the void and she never sees it Then after 24 hours are you unmatched for good If someone pauses their profile so they stay in your queue I actually think this is the case If so its extremely unscrupulous on the part of Bumble because Im essentially deleting my potential matches if their profile is paused without knowing it It would explain why so many matches that have been totally in my wheelhouse havent gotten back to me If I want to match with them I should wait until the the distance measure comes back online Is that correct Does anyone know the answer But then again some women in my queue do disappear Why would that happen Im so confused",0,2422

Two questions here

Should I follow up if she dont respond within a couple days if she doesnt let me know when she available or just leave the ball in her court so it doesnt seem im clingy 

Should I ask her for her number or snapchat right now Or keep her on the dating app and how do I ask Should I be like Can I have youre snapchst or number so we can set up plans on there

"So Im in a disastrous situation I matched with this girl over the weekend we both had verified profiles and we exchanged a few messages and she wanted to move over to Snapchat which I agreed to 

Then almost immediately after we found each other on Snapchat before I even knew her last name she requested a video of me spinning around in a circle in my underwear 

I refused and I immediately got suspicious thinking this was some sort of extortion account So to be diligent I ask her to tell me her last name first She gives me a name and I start googling her looking for any corroborating information online to match what I knew about her already 

Well I was able to confirm her identity I let her know that I did this and she freaks out saying that was the creepiest thing that ever happened to her 

I dont care what she says Im not sorry for looking into her So many men have fallen victim to sextortion and all of the info I found anyone else could have found and if she has got the gall to ask me for such videos she has no business freaking out if I look up her public information 

Anyways she still follows me on Snapchat She checks my storyline She hasnt blocked me I apologized profusely for making her upset but as I said I dont regret looking into her Should I just give up on trying again with her I asked her before things got more quite between us if she wanted to stop talking with me and she never said she didnt want to only that she was upset with me 

I dont know Im getting the feeling that she is actually crazy or something Any advice would be appreciated",0,1581

"As I mentioned this is a weird situation and Id appreciate advice I tend to lack social awareness when it comes to women Im getting better but went to an allmale high school and was relatively introverted besides theater so its taking time

A girl I knew in high school through mutual friends and theater ended up going to the same university with me  We werent really close in high school and she was dating someone else the majority of the time In October of our junior year 2020 we match on Tinder I was going through stuff in life and didnt feel like messaging as I know some people just swipe on people they know

In September our junior year she drunk texts me while out at a restaurant with her sorority sisters small school sorority not huge partiers and is flirting a lot one of the parts of the conversation being me Whats your favorite place to drink her Your apartment  I flirted back but I wasnt really down to meet up with her while she was likely drunk cant be 100 sure but was pretty sure she was

I had to ask her about an upcoming event she was helping with the next time I texted her so I didnt really follow up on that as I assumed most people are embarrassed by drunk texts Didnt get a response

A month later we match on Bumble and the match stayed up for 48 hours with no messages Between the drunk text and this point her roommate followedadded me on multiple areas of social media and commented on some of my posts I invited her out and heard nothing back so I moved on

Last week 6 months later we matched on Bumble again I had found a gf in December but broke things off about a month ago and had deleted my Bumble in the meantime 

I invited her to my fraternitys semiformal because she is a fun person to be around and Im relatively interested  got a really quick response but she already had plans that weekend legitimate plans  she detailed exactly what they were

My questions are 

Am I reading far too much into this Should I just straightup ask her if shes actually interested considering weve matched 3 times on dating apps so far Id have no problem just being friends with her but she seems to have similar interests to me and Id like a chance to get to know her better If I should ask or just ask her out whats a way of doing so given the situation that wont be weird given that I cant do so inperson I rarely saw her on campus preCOVID  with COVID I like wont see her until sometime in the Fall

It appears that Ive been attracting far far more trans and nonbinary folk than I have women who came out of the womb with the erm parts

In fact I have yet to match with the latter at all on anything since rejoining Im not trying to offend anybody and I seriously hope I dont After all I am not at all opposed to the idea of dating someone who is trans or nonbinary so long as theres a strong bondconnection but Im still rather curious as to why this might be

Ive been described as effeminate before and the amount of times someone has mistaken me for a woman over the phone or through text on anonymous apps and things like Twitter has to be in the double digits by now Thats literally all I can think of that might be causing this pattern I feel like the market for guys like that is also pretty low when it comes to anyone the doctor declared a girl at the hospital In fact almost every woman Ive dated was bisexual and many of them werent really looking for a man at first

"Thank you so much Thats the thing though Its just pictures In person theyre going to be seeing me 360 and maybe my expressions are weird or my face looks off from a different angle I lost 50lbs so thats quite a large difference And now I have no real gauge for how strangers perceive me because I havent really gone out much since losing all that weight Before the pandemic I used to go out with my friends who are quite beautiful and I saw the way that guys acted around them Ive never received that kind of attention before Just as an example the last time I went out to eat at a restaurant preCovid was with a friend who is very pretty and the waiter was so entranced by her that he completely forgot to take my order 

So its super overwhelming I worry that maybe Im just photogenic and that Ill disappoint someone when I meet them in person But maybe it will become less scary once I actually start going on dates Havent been using the app for long and Im not super active on it so I havent had any actual dates yet Just trying to play it cool for now and hoping not to come off too insecure because I know that can be a massive turn off",0,1142

I mean you make a lot of good points I never said this was the only reason I just said usually Especially when you put premium accounts into play and women have a large pool of options when men have less If youre swiping on someone who already has to sift through 300 people then its going to take a while for them to even come across your profile So the ratio is a huge part of it Plus given the fact that we have so many profiles to go through it makes us more inclined to be picky just because we dont want to have to talk to dozens and dozens of guys If you take everything I said into consideration it all ties into each other If men swipe with more intent women will have less profiles to go through and be more inclined to swipe more If I have 20 dudes in my queue Im more inclined to swipe on the average guys because the whole point is to talk to people If i have 200 dudes in my queue then Im being super cautious so I dont end up having to message 50 guys in 24 hours And this is all mainly based on my own experiences,0,1029

"gtMost dating apps have an average of a 7030 ratio men to women This is usually why matches seem so rare for the average guy

Matches are rare for the average guy because most women dont want the average guy and thats reflected in their drastically higher standards for swiping right on a given profile Not that theres necessarily anything wrong with that as it makes sense to be picky when you have tons of options but that really is the main reason Even if dating apps were 5050 male to female youd still see every woman getting tons of matches and the majority of men getting little to none",0,593

If we all followed your advice and only matched with 2 people at a time we would still get likes every day and now instead of going through 20 people I have to go through 200 People who liked with me last week may never get a chance to match with me because they get pushed to the bottom of the stack while new likes keep coming and coming That would make things very counterproductive and men would only get even less matches and just have another reason to complain Its not like I can match with them all and leave them to sit I only have 24 hours So Im just supposed to only swipe on recent likes The guy at the bottom could be the love of my life and Ill never know thanks to your advice,0,691
I love when people state their name as the start of their bio when it clearly shows it right above,0,98
Like I said if you feel that way then swipe with intention,0,58
Nothing wrong with that at all I know lots of men and women who just want arm candy and nothing more But Im sure the majority of people would rather have a connection with someone regardless of looks Ill admit I used to be extremely shallow when I first started using dating apps Only going for chiseled 6ft borderline Abercrombie models But as I got older I found that I didnt really care about a guys height Im 54 and if youre taller than me in heels youre okay in my book and thats mostly just because a lot of men dont want to date someone taller than them And Id prefer my guy to look like a real human being not some photoshopped magazine model Am I still shallow Of course I am most people are because at the end of the day we all want to be attracted to our partner,0,773
"And who is forcing you to match with them No one

Women complain about this all the time how OLD is soooo overwhelming The annoying thing is that its your fault when that happens No one forces or tells you to match with a bunch of dudes and try and have conversations with all of them Doing that is self destructive for both genders but its not something men can control its on you because thats the dynamic",0,407

"Ive seen a lot of guys switching their persona between Tinder and Bumble too I feel like Bumble is more geared toward seriously intentions instead of messing around so guys feel they need to mislead you to get a match Ive swiped on girls just to see what its like for men and theres plenty of women out there that are looking for a good time or something casual Hell a lot of girls are looking for something casual and dont want to say that because they feel guys will be too forward A lot of them dont understand theyll get more bees with honey no pun intended they just say what they think we want to hear and act like were all naive little girls who havent had dozens encounters with men and can see right through their bullshit If youre upfront youll get matches that want the same thing Very simple 

If guys are using the app properly then they should have more successes than failures All it takes its to answer all the questions add a few tidbits about yourself in your bio and post some recent photos The more they add to the profile the more I know about them before I swipe and itll make for more successful matches They go into it with very little effort then complain that its not going well",0,1204

She might be worried if she does tell you she doesnt want anything to do with you that you could get upset Upset  you have her address thats a pretty terrifying thing for a woman,0,178
That makes zero sense Youre the one who fills up your queue by continuing to match with people How full your queue is entirely determined by your own actions you decide if youre matched with 2 or 20 people,0,205
Yeah thats just as out of touch with around 3050 of the user base,0,65
"This was a great write up Thank you for putting this together I deleted my account a couple days ago mostly because I noticed a lot of the guys on bumble were also on tinder I too paid for my account so I could see who liked me ahead of time What Ive noticed with tinder is folks will save their likes to get over 1000 people just to be considered a popular user They had no intention of writing back Its more of an ego thing 

The other thing I noticed is that guys were a lot less up front on bumble then they were on tinder For example one dude had his tinder up with something along the lines of Im jacked and just want to make you choke on my anaconda Then on bumble he was like Im just a normal dude looking for anything thats out there Same photos on both profiles 

If I saw they were on both sites with mostly empty profiles I swiped left And to the dude who is giving you crap about having 3050 guys you match with and trying to converse with all of them the thing is its not like it happens all at once Sometimes Ill swipe right on someone weeks ago and theyll match with me later on after Im already talking to 34 guys That starts to add up so its not like its intentional 

I think its funny that folks get so bent out of shape about how many people youre trying to message Not all of them are going to work out not all of them are going to communicate back so yea you usually line up quite a few guys to see who is actually worth spending time talking with 

Just like folks tear each other apart about not opening with more than just Hey we can be picky on who we choose to keep talking to if all theyre going to do is respond with one word sentences I had one guy who I asked like 45 questions to and it was like pulling teeth I was like hey so I see you went skydiving in your photo that looks like you had so much fun Was that recently or was it from awhile ago His response Yea  I tried a couple other questions and unmatched him 

 Anyway thanks for putting this up Ive switched to OkCupid myself since it matches you a bit more on responses to questions than the other sites do and have had more promising prospects there I love bumble and what they do for women but men have started using that site for hookups rather than real relationships Which is fine but not what Im looking for ultimately Hopefully OkCupid doesnt let me down lol otherwise Ill just have to go with asking folks out IRL",0,2413

"Curious that you have such a heavy judgement of him from a few salt shaker emojis yet dont see her involvement as relevant  It shouldnt be that hard of a leap to understand that a more substantive statement is easier to engage with and respond to and that expectations on an app like Bumble would generally be that the woman provide this that is part of the point of the app after all  Its not unreasonable if this guy was expecting that and wasnt engaged enough by her opening message to do that work for her  Perhaps hes desirable enough that matches need to stand out a bit more or perhaps he has similarly harsh judgements that you might have of uninspired opening messages

gtThats what youre supposed to do in that situation

Why couldnt she do the same by just trying another track of conversation

Separate from all that its also possible he could have been responding to not let the 24 hour timer die further indicating his own interest but was otherwise too busy to respond fully at the time  Not everybody lives on the apps or even their phones  We dont exactly have context or insight into his thought process beyondsome emojis",0,1139

"Your answers are hilarious and the main pic is solid but some of the rest are pretty dull

"Have yall heard of Michael Gargiulo He was a serial killer active in Illinois and Los Angeles and on February 21st 2001 he broke into Ashley Ellerins home and stabbed her 47 times as she exited the shower she died Her date was Ashton Kutcher who arrived late to their date and as he knocked on her door she didnt show up although the lights were on he assumed she was blowing him off for being late and he then went home but not after peering through the window to see what he thought was spilled red wine on the carpet from a house party days prior  it wasnt wine he didnt find out she was killed til a day later He testified during the trial of Garguilo about his relationship with Ashley and the circumstances that brought him to the crime scene

Moral of the story dont ghost be mature about it and say good luck with your future endeavors of finding someone  Because I will assume you were murdered and I will be forced to testify at your killers trial and if you ghost me I will not have kind things to say about you

Probably why Im still single",0,1052

Yeah doesnt work when I have a good attitude either Actually its worse because Im get deluded when it doesnt work and Im actually trying And its so lame asking people to take my picture I dont know about you but anyone I ask friends family acquaintances to take a quick picture of me has always been like Ummm WTF Fine I seriously need to clean up and pay someone to do this,0,374
Id just ignore this sort of thing and move on There are some weird weird people out there and youll definitely unearth some during OLD so I would try not to give it much thought,0,177
I do have deep sleep sometimes too according to my family But anytime I had to be on call I still woke up everytime I guess you mentally prepare yourself for it I was doing covid tests at the emergency department with 12 hour shifts so thankfully I had a room to sleep in at night When youre falling asleep you cant stop thinking about how they can literally call you at anytime I would just put the phone next to my head as I was sleeping A couple nights I actually slept the rest of the shift as no other tests were needed and that feels absolutely amazing Otherwise when you have to wake up after 30 min of sleep go do 2 covid tests come back to sleep get woken up again 30 minutes after that it feels like death That ringtone sounds like my nightmares now lol I hate that sound,0,781
Eh the selling point is the allure of it all OLD sucks mostly Ive had some good experiences through it but it pales in comparison to meeting people in real life,0,160
"gtIm very intimidating Thats what Ive been told at least

I could see them saying that but only because they confuse intimidating with selfconfident At least thats the impression Ive got from you so far also on that other post Some men dont know how to deal with that ",0,268

One message a day keeps your dates away,0,39
I know frustrating Have fun on your date though So excited for you,0,66
This could be a bait and switch  Ive heard of extremely desperate dudes using pics of other attractive men to lure women to match with them  After the match they switch to real photos of them Obviously these men are loser catfish that dont respect your intelligence  Seems youre not attracted to the real them anyway so they still lose in the end,0,346
My taste in men is umm well how do you put it nicely I think the term is trash I date trash humans Jkjkjk Ive been doing better with the weeding out process but every now and then I have to throw the whole man out Im very intimidating Thats what Ive been told at least I dont think I am though,0,293

Yeah good stuff like it,0,23
It just strikes me as a bit awkward Like if a coworker you rarely interacted with made a big fuss about missing your birthday The sentiment is nice enough but theyve really overestimated the importance Im placing on their role in my life at that point in time Its not a huge deal if someone sent me this Id thank them for letting me know and Id wish them well I just dont think its necessary and my distress that theyve chosen to quit talking to me for whatever reason is zero,0,476

Im sorry this is cool and all but if you expect everyone to follow up like this then youre treating dating apps like people are getting paid for good customer service I do the above and honestly it gets exhausting I just stay off dating apps and only go in to snag a few people whom I think I can either hook up with or have some kind of romantic FWB or more with It is exhausting following up with so many people though to the point where the above culture influences me to just declare it a 90 waste of time This is my harsh view point on it though,0,550

I got a random Bumble reddit post that showed some ridiculous behavior from a female towards a guy that was similar to what Ive experienced multiple times and it made me irritated enough to actually email Bumble feedback and tell them to fix problems like that and stop encouraging it considering Bumble is now a publicly traded company on NASDAQ Told them to lead by example For the record I no longer use any sort of online social dating platform,0,448
This is kind of bittersweet I remember one guy did this to me It didnt work out and tried to come back I appreciate the initial honesty but Im no ones second choice,0,164

I was so close to having a family It made me really happy spending time with her and her son I dont write I want to get married and start a family on my Bumble since it would scare everyone away and thats the last thing I need but thats the point of all this for me To meet someone who loves me and treats me like a partner and a friend Someone who enjoys doing little things together because those little things mean a lot to me

ok now Im just describing my last relationship but you get it I felt like I had that in my life and I lost it

So for now Im working on myself Working out everyday Joined a rock climbing gym which meets once a week Started writing some stand up to kill the last bit of my selfesteem Working on my own business and juggling a second job idle hands devils playground something something something Im picking my life back up and sharing it would make a lot of hard and difficult life choices worth doing",0,985

Trying new thingsand dont stress too hard on this A restaurant youve never been to or that no one has ever been to because its new is a reliable fallback Use that concept as a foundation you dont have to pretend youre a foodie if you arent one The key is to make it a special few hours and stay positive throughout,0,314

What would you say if you have talked for about a month and suddenly they stop texting you And even if they do its all vague,0,124
I dont feel like it is and Id be kind of embarrassed for whoever sent me something like that when we barely know each other Not upset or anything its well intentioned but theyre clearly about 100 times more invested in online dating than I am if they think whatever string of back and forths we had was so meaningful that I need to be let down gently when it comes to an end If this is ghosting ghost me all day long if youre not feeling me,0,440

"Just get a Google Voice number and use that for dating He will never know the difference and you keep the real you perfectly safe

I agree that he was rude in this particular case  But you cant really blame a guy from wanting to move off the app and get your digits He was probably super frustrated with flakey girls and texts that go nowhere and tried to put it on you So many girls keep on texting forever and have no intention of ever meeting up",0,448

Yup,0,3
Its literally the thing that set bumble apart from tinder especially initially,0,78
I dont understand How is not responding after 3 texts in 3 days even considered ghosting Why do people call everyyhing ghosting when in reality it appears only when you at least meet have something towards eachother and then cut contact without any heads up It wouldnt be ghosting at all Imagine talking to a stranger on a bus for few minutes then this person gets off the bus and you never talk again would you call it ghosting too,0,432

"Well the benefit of Bumble is that no one will have to deal with someone they didnt swipe right on The downside of this is that means the user has to put in the work So if a girl starts an account starts swiping but gets bored she may just take a break for a day week month etc Plus she has to go through wayyyy more people than the guys 

On Hinge technically a girl can just create a profile sit back relax and just watch the likes come pouring in However that does mean getting bombarded with way more likes from people theyre not interested in and then they get frustrated and potentially delete the app

1 Snowman pic  I like it you look good in it and theres a smile in it but like you said zoomed out and has very bad lighting
2 Half face  dog pic  Nah
3 For the photos in car
   1 Half smile  pass
   2 
   3 Better than 1 and 2 in the original post lighting is soso since its a car pic idk if you can touch up the pimple or not I liked the hair in your original 3 more even though its kinda messy but messy works sometimes When its down it looks kinda flat same happens for me so maybe add some direction to it or I think for you itd look better up Id add some product to it and wear it up a medium hold  matte finish would be my goto but you could try out something with a stronger hold
      1 Hanz De Fuko may still have a BOGO sale going on with code YARUNO I also got a complimentary 10 gift card in my order from 2 weeks ago so I paid 23 for 2 containers and a 10 gift card Sweet deal

   6 Hat hair  pass
   7 Hat  pass

And remember that this is the dateequivalent of a resumé so while you dont have to wear a buttonup shirt for every pic it probably shouldnt be a Tshirthoodie for every pic

As for the smile I know its hard to get a full smile that doesnt look fakeforced sometimes I put on some standup until Im laughing and then try to hold that smile It feels so awkward but if it works it works

"gtIs 6ft uncommon

No but its basically a free pass to online dating saying that as a 62 guy who has always been pretty successful I think primarily for that reason unless Im more attractive than I think but I really dont think I am

OK so take this as its meant and in the context that Im talking about your profile and not you you look a lot older than 27 in some of your pictures I dont think your main pic is flattering and that is a big issue as people will swipe left based on that single picture alone they wont bother looking at the others if the first doesnt pass muster

BUT Im not sure any on there are a suitable replacement You have a great smile your second picture from a compositionprofile pic point is perfect but for the fact its blurry I know why as you have cropped out the lady what you want is one like that same vibe same smile but totally clear

Its sort of a theme with your pics generally doesnt matter how great looking you are poor pics are a killer in online dating generally and definitely in a matching model like Bumble You just need better pictures over all I think you are a decent looking guy the raw materials are there but it just needs to be presented in the right way 

Its tough for guys we dont take pics and so when you get to something like this its hard But you need to get a friend to help you will need to take loads play around with it and you will end up with say 4 thats all you need But if you do the advice from me is different outfits different locations different poses like literally consider it a fashion shoot take a couple of jackets change of Tshirt You equally dont want 5 all in the same Tshirt as its obvious Selfies are fine for one or two also give those a go the more you do it the more comfortable you will become 

Finally my standard About Me advice paint a picture of US as a couple what are we doing where we going on a date Im not liking the idea of going to a dive bar or just sitting around watching a movie smoking drugs and drinking thats what is in my mind reading your About Me even if that is representative of you it shouldnt be the imagine on your profile dont lie just paint a better picture of the truth",0,2184

Since I updated I did add a slightly old pic of me smiling and full body toohttpsimgurcomafNML1Xd but it suffers from bad quality photo and its quite zoomed out 

I also considered this onehttpsimgurcomaMQf7NLk but not only is my face barely in it my hair and facial hair are such a mess so idk about it I guess my eyes and my dog look alright but thats about all So any opinions on those would be great 

I do have a picture of me smiling tending my arms and laughing at myself but its a mirror selfie and a dirty mirror at that

"Pics

1 Its an alright pic but an emotionless selfie  dont lead with it
2 Same  but grainy pic quality
3 Good dog pic put after any pics of you
4 Grainy pic quality but now youve shown your hair
5 Good sport pic

Id replace 2 with a pic where youre smiling pref not a selfie def not a mirror selfie and move it to 1 Also keep in mind that camera distance from your face distorts your features a close camera makes everyones nose look worse Your nose doesnt look bad or anything just bringing up that having all close pics isnt helping you

You also need a pic of you with friends or family sport pic doesnt count If the smiling one you replace 2 with is like that then great 2 birds with 1 stone If you can replace 4 with a better quality pic showing your hair thatd be good and move your dog pic to last

You should also be able to see your teeth and physique in at least one of your pics Doesnt need to be full body but usually the friendsfamily pics shows you from at least your waist up

Bio

A bit wordy and since youre not smiling in any pics the first line could come across to some as lemme take you alone to a remote mountainforest where you couldnt say no because of the implicationhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyUafzOXHPE Just say something else about hiking trips that gets the same point across

I might go with something less wordy like

gtLove camping and going on road trips but also chilling with games ordering food and binging Netflix  
gt  
gtSo much to do in life and so little time to do them all

Other

Well I dont have problems with talking to a girl Usually when I have normal conversation I can convert it into a date But the problem is that someone are not starting the conversations Or just say one thing and dip away,0,219
Maybe your standards are too high then you are just shallow and only swipe on the good looking bad boys then PersonalitygtLooks,0,127
Yeah I think I set my expectations too high after I got so many likes But then they disappeared,0,95
Actually the ratio is more fairly distributed than that,0,55
Not really Most of the dudes want to fuck and thats it Lots of wasted time,0,74
Shes boring,0,11
Thats a nice line Might steal  yeah I think its personal choice and Im not at all going to say that everyone should do what Im doing but I think his reaction was pretty telling Most others Im chatting to have asked for my number but when Ive explained Id rather wait until date 1 theyve been fine about it,0,305
Maybe shes on hold with Taco Bell about that quesarito,0,54
People who dont understand the meaning of and confuse me This is even worse than the way too common try and,0,107
Imagine being burnt out because you have so many people interested in you lmfao thats pretty privilege for you,0,110
Thf she just got done at the gym so was probably driving home and showering A quick haha was her way of responding while preoccupied doing other stuff Besides what else would she say to that Yeah Go get that water,0,213
There are a ton of customers If the ratio of men to women is 10 to 1 they could be setting 100 of the women up with successful matches and still retain 80 of their customers,0,173

"This feels to me like a personal choice issue some people are ready to hand out phone numbers to total strangers some people are more comfortable meeting a total stranger for a conversation in a highly public place  And there are some yes who fall off either end of that spectrum who seem like the crazy sort to me
When I get asked for my number I tell them that I prefer to do that the old world Hollywood style and write it on a cocktail napkin and slide it across the bar to them",0,482
I mean whats she supposed to respond to that Hyping you up to grab water,0,72
"I get no matches at all  Like none I know Im not the most attractive guy but I figured Id at least get an occasional match  Not a single one in over six months now  Ive had two different people help with my profile one male one female and still nothing  Any tips the community could give me

httpsimgurcomaLFijH50",0,313
"Huh Im confuseddid this conversation take place on the 13th You asked if she was into nature and she hasnt responded since 

My guess is she met someone else or matched with someone else",0,186
Its not your fault she was probably talking to multiple guys at once and then focused on the one she deemed better Just do the same talk to multiple girls and focus on the one you prefer that doesnt ghost,0,204
"Im a guy and I dont really feel comfortable exchanging numbers until after I meet someone But I have had women give me their number before the meetup

I dont think theres a rightwrong answer here Its about your comfort level",0,224
Or she got burned out from messaging multiple people and is not unintentionally ghosting,0,88
Yesssss All the time Its so frustrating,0,39
Its just how it is unfortunately Most just send me a Hey how are you and then ignore me for days After 5 days I unmatch whats the point in sticking around Imagine someone doing that in person People get busy and most women get tons of matches but if they cant send a quick hey Ill get back to you or whatever then its best to move on,0,333
I was looking up the definition of honor how did I end up here,0,62
Its the best and easiest way to get your match to like you and this person clearly did not try in the slightest lmao,0,116

But with that said an angry reaction to not wanting to exchange them for safety is a massive red flag I always exchange them because nobody has ever said no You very likely dodged a bullet with a control freak",0,251

"I literally dont see the issue here this is one exerpt If they only ever responded with this way mayyybe I would see your point

If shes actively responding to me im happy",0,171
And what I said was none of that  pointing out facts doesnt invoke anything Funny that you didnt even copy and paste correctly injecting transphobia when the dictionary link doesnt even mention it If you are going to try spewing idiotic woke liberal bs in a lame attempt to judge people over absolutely nothing at least get it right,0,332
 Itsalready happening Has been for a while,0,42
In my experience people who are aggressively interested in my trust for them are the last people I should be trusting Seems to me its their way to pick out good marks from the crowd,0,181
Sounds like they dont have a good sense of humour,0,49
For sure but thats why people create Google numbers kik snap etc to talk outside of OLD apps but still protect themselves,0,121
Not to mention the age difference too 35 to 30 hahaha,0,53
Thats truth Hes predicting replies,0,34
Haha is literally one of the worst texts to try and reply to,0,60
I do have something better to suggest Not being such a try hard simp all the time,0,81
Dont think you did anything wrong It happens She may have been messaging a load of other people  its hard to keep up several conversations at once and ones where youre just not feeling quite the right energy or where youre a little less enthusiastic about them just have to get dropped Next time maybe,0,301
"Because most at least somewhat attractive girls use it for either texting only and validation They would get lets say 100 matches and will intended to chat to 25 of them and meetup with a few  most likely chad or thyrone type for the ones in their 20s Or a perfect soulmate beta provider for the ones in their 30s and beyond

Online dating is like a cave age society where only the top 5 males fuck the top 60 females",0,417
Seriously Lol,0,13
"Its just the nature of online dating Unlike real life you are competing with X amount of other guys and or girls and their life outside of the app concurrently     
     
She might have gone somewhere had something to do etc She might have found someone else to talk to I forget to reply all the time and sometimes Ill get back to it and other times I move on to the next match and new conversation when I come back",0,415

I prefer not to give my number out any more  Last time I did she searched it and mentioned a lot of things Id not mentioned to her yet business name which lead to my name which lead to a friend request on Facebook about a month after our first and last date lol

Happy to exchange numbers before the second date though",0,404
"Its a pretty good profile main advice is About Me isnt really a chance to say things about you its a change to create a vision about US It needs to read like an elevator pitch for a date what are we doing where are we going not directly but paint a picture on what you are like via the things you do if that makes sense

As it stands its coming off as sorry too busy to actually date you or take you anywhere nice",0,413

"You dont get many opportunites to say things in Bumble so two things dont waste the ones you do have and second dont be negative or needy 

By all means make a joke but dont over do it",0,184
It is attractive but bragging about it in a bio is not If you are successful then show me that by behavior  good manners pick the girl up nicer place for the date instead of a dive bar,0,184
"Its a good profile and I like your pictures generally as a good mix but I dont think your main pic is going to work too well 

What you really want is the pic of you with the two guys BUT without them if that makes sense Its nice you have a nice smile and its not as in your face as your main one but of course its difficult to replicate that as its clear its a candid pic where you are naturally happy and having fun 

Unfortunately due to the composition it wouldnt work as a cropped photo",0,491
Haha didnt saw that at first,0,28
definitely a good call not giving him your number,0,49
Dont judge unless youve got something better to suggest,0,55
Yeah fair enough I wouldnt change your approach out of the mild annoyance it gives men including myself I realise its probably a bit different meeting strangers as a women,0,171

Ummm hi,0,7
Hes WAAAYYYYY too young for that,0,32
"Yeah though if he was worried about catfishing etc he could have asked for a video chat or more pictures I do have a verified profile though idk how much that counts for 

I get that it can be tiring for men when women assume youre a potentially murdererabuserstalker but its pretty tiring having to be on guard for that sort of thing too",0,338
Its fine mate maybe are you into hiking is marginally better but cant be the deal breaker I would say dont overthink it very easy to do I still overthink this shit all the time,0,176
Thats totally understandable and assuming the date goes well Id exchange numbers at that point usually,0,102
I think if you meet you can meet in a public place go home alone and not risk too much other than them knowing that you look like which they already do but if they have your phone number they can harass you which happened to me before and even blocking them isnt that helpful if theyre able to use other phones,0,310

"Id probably unmatch too  So many people waste your time and the Bumble app is horrid for conversation   Why not just use snap or kik or something easier to talk over that can still conceal your number  It gets a little frustrating as a guy having women assume youre a murderer also  There are much better ways to handle that imo

Im also guessing this guy has had women ghost him or has been cat fished  You can share more pictures and its easier to verify someone off bumble",0,475

"Firstly definitely not normal and you did absolutely nothing wrong dont give your number out if youre unsure

That said I prefer to swap numbers just before a date Im a man as I find it makes logistics way easier I  hate using the app to for real time messaging If women dont want to exchange numbers no stress but I wont message them again on the app after the date I figure if they still dont trust me or like me enough to give me their number after meeting in person its not going anywhere",0,492
Ypu slept with 20 likes Damn way to go,0,38

Yeah and I would have happily met in person or video called or something I didnt say it in a rude way either he was asking for my number in a jokey way I responded in a jokey way but saying sorry Id prefer not share my number until weve met And then he leaps in with this trust issues thing Like I think its pretty sensible and not an issue If hed tried to arrange meetings and Id kept cancelling or something then fair enough but I just find it weird that this is the hill he chooses to die on,0,494
So that was a lie,0,17
The trend of loving the office is one thing I do not understand Startups seem cool putting dogs in your profile is basic as hell,0,128
"I dont open the app every day so Ive missed out on some potential matches

"You were right not to give your number 
That said I also know where hes coming from 

Ive had so many girls on bumble talk and waste my time I gauge their seriousness and interest by their willingness to move off the app 

Now it doesnt have to be a phone number It can be a bumble video chat or something else 

TLDR you did nothing wrong but a lot of guys get tired of the bumble dance that leads to an eventual ghost 

If youre not comfortable chatting off app and you like the guy consider other alternatives",0,512
Im curious as to what kind of person shes looking for,0,53

"The main thing I would suggest removing is the Just hoping this works bit It makes it sound like youre all out of options when it comes to dating  which isnt the sentiment you want to be putting across to a potential match

as far as photos go try to make sure you include at least one photo smiling with teeth ideally in a setting where the smile is a bit more candid maybe youre at a bar with some friends or engaged in your favourite hobby or something similar The person on the other end of the app needs to see that youre a positive person and that you dont have meth teeth lol",0,582
"Im currently changing my bio as we speak and I also removed the superpower part for something a little more suggestive haha so Ill update when Ive changed it 

Thank you though I definitely wouldnt consider myself to be good looking at all and I have no idea how to take pictures well so thats why Im probably not using it to my advantage as you would say",0,355

I honestly have to keep on reminding myself of this Just last  night I went back to Tinder to see a girl who I was supposed to meet this Friday for a s3x date unmatched me when she was the one telling me lets see each other Oh well gotta keep that abundance mindset,0,265
And yet men are constantly told not to send and ridiculed for sending dic pics Talk about mixed messages Yall need to get together and write shit down If we have some simple rules we can follow we will Every girl says no dic pics and goes out with the dic pic guy They wouldnt do it if it didnt work,0,299

" Wow  Very well

Your comment resonates with me All those personality traits you listed at the end Sounds close to what my friends say about me I get along well with them

But when I am invited by one of them usually the ones who are married or are not single Ill show up to the event without any expectations or ulterior motives to have sexual intercourse with the single women there nor to meet my proverbial soulmate Nevertheless Ill be treated as a leper Mind you I would have refrained from doing awful jests or have any delusions of grandeur of being the center of attention due to my comedic prowess 

I can recall an instant where I showed up to a party I said no more than one or two things like introducing myself to someone I have not yet been acquainted to irregardless of their gender I was then told while the occasion was at its conclusuon That I was too wordy  by a friend to my associates girlfriend

Women say men are superficial On the surface that might seem true But as you scratch beneath the surface you will realize that things like height and even their body types will get any attractive or even agreeable man shut down from wooing their paramour 

I have often witnessed many a man from heights 5 foot and 9 inches and beyond getting away with the utmost offensive behaviour in many social situations especially with women

My height is 5 foot 7 inches to whom it may concern A height I lament very much It deters any chance of gaining affection from women so much That I am considering becoming a homosexual

 I hope you find that rephrasing more sober

2 Lighting sucks on your face you can keep it but move it further than 2
3 Awkward posture good lighting
4 Solid nature pic
5 Lighting is soso Id ditch this one or 2

You need a pic that includes friends or family I would work on improving your posture even if only for pictures I know I mentioned 3 but everyone will have an awkward posture during a solo pic in a park Im talking more about the slouching

And imo you would look better without the under beard  at least none on your neck This is coming from a straight guy 27 yo who can barely grow any facial hair so take it with a huge grain of salt but I think a ducktail beard would look good on you Ik that can take forever to grow but just saying

httpsimgurcomgalleryPONQPvihttpsimgurcomgalleryPONQPvi

 Here it is would love to hear honest criticism proudly as Ive been complimented on my physical appearance many times in real life by fellow local females so my confidence is intact and will stay like that even if someone roasts me so please go hard on me lol But this app makes me feel like something is wrong with my profile Lets start the roasting session if there is something bland about my profile Go go Many thanks in advance  


Edit In the Imgur pictures the screenshots look zoomed in which is making the quality of the pictures seem bad and weird its not like that in the actual bumble app",0,842

You have a great start Like your vibe and the facial hair Pic 4 needs to be your lead photo followed by pic 1 Delete the dog its too grainy and the mountain photo Its beautiful but serves no purpose plus theres a woman in it Your photo with the other women is a nice smile But be aware they might just be friends but a potential date does not want to see you with other women Can you get one more with a full body shot   Your about me is good and the babies waving back line is very cute Drop the rest Use some prompts that are more romantic or about her or what you are looking for,0,582
Please elaborate,0,16

I read the bio before swiping right Pictures are great but if the bio is going to tell me itll never work why waste both of our time,0,132
They dont let you make a new account I tried They block your number and your App Store account However I used an android emulator on PC and signed up with a free texting service number Somehow it gave me free premium and I found her and got her number,0,251
Geez This person lost before they even played the game,0,54
If its a decent friend just ask them whats up and if the person may be interested in you Absolutely nothing wrong with that Thats probably far better than you praying they swipe back Be proactive go ask you friend,0,213

From my own experience and from the stats youve posted youre better off without it Bumble was probably the worst experience Ive ever had in terms of its impact on my psyche,0,172
Idk this is actually a pretty good bio IMO I dont support giving people a free pass for their repetitive bs on dating apps so someone who takes this approach on their bio is usually a swipe right in my book,0,206
Pretty sure bumble just autobans anyone that gets reported more than once or twice Got banned like a year and a half ago even tho I literally never said a mean word to anyone on there so I just made a new account,0,212
I am happy to review your profile,0,33
Yeah I am 57 myself I know for sure that my dating pool would have been substantially larger But I think that gets better with time If you are 27M make a good living then suddenly you become whole lot more attractive Dating would be much easier then,0,249
Oh wow well yeah I could see why you got banned tho lol,0,55
Youre getting actual messages All the girls Ive matched with didnt even message me ,0,83
You def have to give it more time and dont check it daily Youll drive yourself nuts Many of my friends that have met spouses and SOs on bumble were online average of 8mos to a year before finding the right match,0,211

HAHA I mean you didnt lie ,0,26
Usually before I am about to delete a profile I change my height to something like 63 Then all of a sudden I start getting more likes I was on Match once when you could see who viewed you and if your messages were read or not Changed my height and all of a sudden my unread messages started turning to read and my profile got a bunch of views Just goes to show my messages and profile were being filtered out With changing my height being the way to make stuff not get filtered Still deleted my profile Not like I am going to lie then show up way shorter than they expect Still nice to see that my only options are the bottom 5 who have to settle for a shorter guy,0,664

Match  Only one person responded out of many messages She merely answered any question I asked without asking me anything or showing any interest in anything I offered up as conversation So that lasted like 3 or 4 messages

Hinge  Again one response only She seemed to be going off of a script and I stopped once she mentioned her MLM

Maybe Ill have someone write a profile for me and see what happens And there must be some unemployed person in my area who will be willing to meet and take a few new pics of me as all of mine basically suck I guess",0,575

Ok so change your pics so your face is clear not in the shadow from your hat or covered up More photos of just you Dont make girls check out a different guy Change all your bio etc The swipe left joke doesnt work makes it sound like you dont match even if true dont announce it say what things you are intowhat you like instead It should be about you Get rid of the financial joke at the end Makes you sound poor even if you arent you dont want a girl to think about your financial situation Sometimes less is more leave a bit of intrigue You dont have to fill out everything Hope that helps And dont take it to seriously ,0,622

But the larger point and why I assume your first post got a parade of downvotes havent bothered to read all the hate is that it isnt about whether someone is capable of doing it Going to Venice for holiday and then still actually taking the time to go for a 5k run every morning is not a personality type that everyone wants to be dating Most people want to be allowed not to be intense 24x7 and be capable of relaxing",0,679

Wait manipulate men mentally Now THAT is something only simps should need to worry about  Choose women that arent that way and there shouldnt be a problem Its obvious when a woman is trying to use looks to manipulate dont fall for it and maybe choose better,0,257
Some people look for someone to hate the same thing as themnothing wrong with thatbut to put it this upfront and blunt well Some would say this comes off as bitter,0,163
But women manipulate mens feeling to make them pay They have different tactics to manipulate mentally ill men to pay If you defend this kind of mentality then you are parte of the problem,0,187
Women dont make men pay they do it willingly,0,44
I dont think a majority of girls do that but i think many very attractive women do that So ofcourse you see a super sexy girl online and find out shes only advertising its gonna be a disappointment  Key is to fully read profiles vs super swiping If you just swipe on attractive photos of course many will be advertising their job is to grab your attention and try to play you,0,375

Not sure what kind of activities I could cultivate an interest in which would be fun looking to share with a date Assuming I was doing these things  I would most likely have someone to be doing them with already Seriously dont understand how I am going to turn myself into hobby guy all of a sudden Are guys who are excited about all of their fun lifestyle activities just into them because it gets them dates I like normal things but its not like Im going to start taking on hobbies and going to do them all by myself Then what pay someone to take pictures of me doing my hobbies so I have something to post on my dating profile What ever type of fun dating activities I need to prove I am into  if I was actually out doing these things then I would apparently have someone to do them with in the first place At the very best I can blame the coronavirus pandemic on not doing all of these exciting things that I need to be doing to entice women into going out with me,0,968

No I 100 think men should be worried about being mugged or attacked in dark allys BY OTHER MEN Which is my point All the things you mentioned about not having support in place for men and not being allowed to speak your emotions is created by a patriarchal society so maybe educate yourself on why we are the way we are and try to change it from the inside,0,356

And do you think men are safer on dark alley ways A man like me who is 53 ca easily get mugged and murdered Women are not the only ones having it rough sweetheart We have to worry about that as well Not just that but we also have to worry about false rape allegations which can ruin our lives we have to never hit a woman not even in self defense Some of us will never get a relaitonship or have sex because of our apperreances women have many support systems while men have none women can speak out their feelings while men have to shut up and take it Suicide rates for men are a lot higher than womens So if you think you are having it rougher than men think again Try and be more empathetic towards the opposite gender it might help you a bit,0,745

"Okay so OP is most likely in the top 15 of earners in the United States considering hes a software engineer For his age hes probably closer to the top 7 Hes also not a bad looking guy  In other words his value in the dating marketplace is INCREDIBLY HIGH  

There are studies that show that dating apps have lowered self esteem in men Which might explains why a man like OP is willing to settle for a single mom with 3 kids 

Unpopular opinion here but lets be real theres a REASON why someone with three kids is a single mom

Why should OP give his resources to take care of someones 3 kids A moms FIRST priority is HER KIDS Her man is probably the 5th person on her list of priorities Why would OP deal with the kind of drama that comes along with trying to be a stepfather He doesnt have time for that

OP deserves better There are women out there for him that want a family want marriage and are NOT the selfconsumed type that youre describing Hes just looking in the wrong place Dating apps are NOT it",0,1006

Anywaythe desire to want to see more long term effects isa tough one It does seem somewhat rational but it rubs me as one of those rationalizations to hide less socially acceptable views Part of my suspicion on that is because its not really that rational The long term effects of COVID19 dont look to be all that great so it seems to me theyre not doing a complete costbenefit analysis It would seem theyre only doing the analysis so far as it arrives at the conclusion they desired And then theres the problem of ignoring the impact on others though that gets into the isought problem which is then separate from the rationality of the viewpoint",0,1072

"I agree with Tri here I used all the dating apps from around 2016 to 2019 and only met 3 or 4 girls I ended up dating one for 6 months Ive never had a problem talking to girls in person but my job kept me away from my home for months on end and it was difficult to talk to someone who was about that life

I apologize to any women who get offended by my next paragraph But that statement is from my own interactions with the opposite sex on TinderBumblehingeblah blah blah 

These apps may have been the bees knees back in the day but they are just absolute trash now Full of bots scammers and self absorbed little girls who want to validation and have nothing to offer in terms of life fulfillment

I think your profile is mostly fine and most of your pics look good except for the 2nd one on page 3 Not the most natural expression there Also move cat pic up the line because cats Also as someone who also tends to swipe left on sapiosexuals I probably wouldnt put that in the PS just comes off kind of negative and you probably want to focus on saying positive things about yourself in that part rather than dunking on others,0,427

This is actually good advice If you prefer to take things slows and talk online for a bit to get to know each other any guy who wants a quick hook up will probably just stop talking to you or ghost you after you tell them you prefer to keep talking online for now I mean there still is a pandemic Basically you shouldnt even worry about meeting with guys who just want hook ups because theyll just filter themselves out when they see you prefer to take things slow,0,464
No I dont think weve matched before I just cant tell if hes currently active or not considering either way he liked me on it two months ago,0,139

4 great move this to 1 wish the tree branch wasnt blocking the sun on your face but no big

"You fit my definition of pretty not my definition of feminine as far as your physical features go  

I didnt use a trans person looks to belittle you or masculine looks to belittle them 

 I used your masculine features along with your wigs to show why guys might ASSUME you are trans and not engage with you 

This isnt about insults or belittling its about preference which you yourself mentioned having  How people feel about dating within the  trans community is much more delicate a subject than how you feel about dating  pretty boys but its still about an individuals taste  

As far as ghosting it comes down to damned if you do and damned if you dont  For instance if I ask if youre trans and you say yes well my preference isnt into trans women no matter how attractive you are  If I ask and you say no well I probably just shot down any chance with you because youd be upset I thought you looked trans maybe not you its just an example",0,946

Was on Match too And doesnt seem like too many profiles are actually active They have a wonderful scam where you can pay extra to allow inactive profiles to be able to respond Really though my profile never got views and messages didnt get read  At one point it just became a game to see if I could get a profile view or a message read Turns out changing my height to 64 actually turned a bunch of messages read and got my profile viewed

"Most people look different when you meet them in person Even people that dont wear makeup or use filters Like you said we all put up our best pictures We take pictures in the best lighting An unfiltered picture taken in natural lighting is very honest but its still no guarantee that it will show all flaws and its not gonna show what a person looks like in nasty fluorescent lighting 

Most men dont wear makeupuse filters but I am still usually anywhere from surprised to shocked when I see most guys in person after first seeing them in photographs

Sometimes its obvious that they lied about their height or weight and other times I cannot figure out why I thought they were so attractive in their pictures but not attractive in person Sometimes I just cant figure out what is different I just dont like it 

I often wonder if people think I look different in person I cant know because I only see myself in mirrors and pictures Ha",0,935

Looks wise youre average Honesty is important here to help you succeed not like the girl that commented here saying everything is perfect with your profile and that the guys are intimidated Thats a cop out and she is giving you that fake optimism to help you feel better in the moment Im sure what you want is success with online dating and the evidence that something is wrong with your profile comes from the results The first picture is doing you a disservice As other people here have said more pictures with the short hair The 2nd pic should be your main",0,1014

IMHO that sounds like a headache  If you really wanted to pursue it and be careful try moving forward with video calls  Trying to make a long distance relationship work where you dont physically see the other person every dayevery other day or something is just never going to work and it will suss out if shes catfishing you or just scamming you for a VISA in someway  But if you were looking for advice Id say move on and change your filters to woman you could actually meet up with in person,0,494

Damn dude youre gonna end up in rniceguys,0,41
I love how if a woman doesnt fit someones exact definition of pretty and feminine its okay to use trans as an insult which in general is never alright There is no certain way a trans person looks and their identity is not a way to belittle others  I dont have soft delicate features on my face and naturally long pretty hair so I am default masculine oh no I dont mind being androgynous at all But Justifying that sort of immature reasoning isnt cool and if its the type of guy that thinks in that sort of bigoted manner  Im glad we didnt have a conversation ,0,559

"Am I the only one thinking that being attracted by people of a certain height shape or with specific traits is normal and okay and whats not okay is just to be a dick to people who dont fit your criteria

I mean whether its height boob size abs ass shape jaw line nose type or just how ones face looks in general we are all attracted by physical attributes that are for the most part largely beyond the control of their owner That doesnt make you an asshole Its okay to be attracted only to people tall or with big boobs its just the way it is you dont choose what attracts you

Whats stupid is being a dick to people that dont attract you whether its calling them midgets or faties or whatever but as long as you respectfully states what you are attracted to it should be okay

Reading the other comments on this thread it seems this guy is just as much an asshole because he enjoys large breasts as he is because he states it in a hickytackymean way while the latter should be the only valid reason just like its fine when a girl says on her bio she is XXX tall and would feed attracted to someone at least as tall as her for instance",0,1136

"I had a dinner date with a woman with gorgeous hair I could barely stop commenting how great it looked all lustrous and super stylish Turns on it was a wig she was going through cancer treatment She let nothing get in her way So thumbs up to wigs

Plus wigs give a woman the unique and hot ability to add more spice to her look which is always fun

I dont think mentioning the wig in the profile is necessary at all It can be disclosed right before meeting in person the first time after a man gets the pleasure of getting to know your personality through texting and over the phone or video Besides your short hair is clearly in your beach photo

You have a great smile Show it in every picture to show off your fun and adventurous side

Avoid using the word Buddy which can infer being relegated to the dreaded friend zone 

Change Dont know yet to Relationship or Marriage

You do say in your bio that you have a lot of wigs maybe add that it is because of a medical issue I dont think it should matter but because I like your natural hair I thought it was a particular style choice that I could not understand

"Theres an interesting binary that people seem to fall in to with the idea that someone wants you for sex or doesnt  But in a healthy romantic relationship people want you for a lot of reasons  Your personality your sexuality your skills your lifestyle your sense of humor all of it  Sex is one of the many factors involved  I can tell you that personally when Im thinking of whether I want to consider someone as a partner Im looking at a wide variety of factors and if any one of them doesnt work Ill back off  A physically attractive body is one of those factors  Sos her sense of self knowledge  Sos her altruism Sos her humor  Sos her ability to have an actual informed debate where were both trying to understand each others points of view  The fact that I have a partner with a great butt does not change the fact that I love our political debates together and vice versa  Her talents as a writer do not change the fact that dat booty though

In our society we often teach that women are always desirable for sex  Sex sells  And many women take in that message and think I am wanted but only for my body  And often they accidentally reinforce that idea  If you think the only thing desirable about you is your body then you will show off your body and nothing else when advertising yourself for a relationship and in doing so youll accidentally be signaling that all you have to offer in relationships is sex  And that can result in men who really would be interested in the rest of you acting sexual quickly towards you because they really have nothing else to relate to you on and never even realizing theres something else theyd like about you  


So you want to connect with people on more than just sexuality  Good  If you want serious relationships thats very important  Make a point of trying to connect on those other levels  Its okay to even say in your profile that youd like to be friends first  A lot of guys will jump to sex talk because were not even sure what else to try to connect on  If you clearly state your hopes on that point most of us will follow your cues  Those that dont you can drop because you shouldnt date people who dont match your needs",0,2175

Youll only get burned if you try to make it look different than it naturally is Confidence really is key if you look confident with your hair guys will be more confident that its actually pretty hot If you come out of the gate hiding it it makes them question it was ever as hot as they thought it was  

The sad truth is physical attraction is a big part of Bumble You only get a few sentences to relate a diverse and intricate personality so you cant really be judged on your personality Unless you are looking for specific traits religion political stance etc then usually you just judge on looks",0,929

First the OP made a move that I can totally understand when being approached in this manner Being constantly objectified had to wear on you and I cant even imagine being a woman online It would be exhausting to constantly be asked to be spank bank material for any guy that funds you remotely attractive Being called any number of shitty things simply for not wanting to provide pictures of yourself nude or calling out shitty behavior Men we need to do better we need to BE better",0,1037

Im never on them much past a month before I have found what I was looking for 

Yet when I do come back on the amount of people you see still on there and its fairly easy to tell they never came off is pretty eye opening and frankly worrying I suspect there are a number of reasons but yeah decent people wont hang around long and so dating apps have a fairly high ratio of undateable people in whatever form

"How old are you Makes all the difference in what advice I would give 

Your expectations are not in any way unrealistic any decent human being would treat you with respect and take their time getting to know you My personal way of handling this as a man is to assume sexual talk is off limits until told otherwise sure you can throw little bit of innuendo out see what happens but its really for you both to escalate in an appropriate manner Nobody on either side should be escalating sexual chat without properly assessing if it is appropriate to do so for the other person 

Where you expectations might be off is with online dating in general It is for the most part a cluster fuck you need to develop slightly thicker skin to deal with not being negative towards you its just a reality I have always found what I want on dating apps had a very successful long term relationship and now in another relationship that looks like it will have legs as it were But you do need to accept that getting to that place might take time and there will be plenty of negative interactions along the way 

Sadly your concept of all men want is sex is firstly quite wrong even if a lot do but online dating isnt going to change your mind on that The reality is unfortunately that its for the most part full of people who cannot communicate properly and are actually quite bad at this sort of thine if they were not then its unlikely they would be there for long anybody decent and I link to consider myself in that doesnt hang around long and thats been my experience when I do online dating its for maybe a month max before I have found something meaningful and moved off again There are decent people out there but it takes work and effort to find them That is where the thick skin comes from you just need to handle it in the right way mentally 

Im not one to suggest therapy to a total stranger or anyone but I think you will need to consider how you handle your past relationships and come to terms with the fact not all interactions will be this way I wont assume how you interact but honestly its very easy to tell when people put up barriers and you would need to consider this in many ways those barriers may encourage more of the thing you dont want

OkCupid is alright and most likely to result in actual conversation but rarely proceeds any further than online if youre like me and mostly match with foreigners like Americans who are on the other side But if nothing else Ive gotten gaming friends from there Tinders getting me the most local matches dates and meetings that go beyond online interaction

"youre a good looking fellow no wonder the lads are liking it 

My advice

Definitely become 21 thatll be good

IMO your first two photos are a little too tough guy compared to the more sensitive side the other photos reveal I would at least try moving those photos back and using a smiling or instrument photo

I dont feel like I really know that much about you from your profile except for hobbies Hobbies are a good way to connect but theyre not your entire personality Having a vaccination going for rides picking a place to eat all nice but all vague and a little too safe

I think the perfect first date prompt is a bit of a missed opportunity Grabbing coffee and seeing how it goes is very basic Everyone your age is likely meeting for coffee because you cant legally drink  you couldve used this space to maybe reveal a bit more about yourself or what someone can expect from dating you I would add in another prompt and try to dig deeper when it comes to your personality beyond hobbiesschooldate locations

I personally dont think its wise to put I dont know yet on Bumble because it reduces the  of people swiping on you from either direction if they know what they want And if people use the filters to find people interested in relationships or whatever they wont even come across your profile and I think women use filters more than men I would just go with whatever feels MORE right and see how you fare",0,1417

"As a guy while I dont necessarily get the same from women I dont tend to get much better So many just never message at all letting matches expire Those who do message may message just a handful of times and then never message again despite my efforts to carry a conversation

Thats discouraging and it then makes me feel like not putting in effort Id say OLD can create a cycle of cynicism where people continue to get discouraged and put in less and less effort as a result

I also hear that men tend to swipe right more than women and so I suppose that also leads to them putting in less effort with the matches they get Theyre focusing more on quantity than quality and consequently the quality of conversation also suffers perhaps

Just my thoughts

I will confess in my earlier days of OLD I was bad at being the one to just stop messaging back or unmatching instead of at least sending a message to say I was not really interested anymore So I sadly contributed and still occasionally do to this cycle of cynicism ",0,1020

Well the sooner you realize that you are most likely just one of the drops in the bucket they are working with the easier it is to deal with being ghosted or the chat dying off Online dating is a numbers game no one stops swiping as soon as they get a match Build up a respectable bullpen and then focus your attention on the top percent Ive matched with girls that will send a generic ass message and then not respond anymore Matches disappear if there is no communication within 24 hours of matching so Im convinced they only send the message as a place holder so they have something to fall back on when the guys they really want to hang out with drop them,0,659

"Yes I sensed that and theres certainly a lot of enjoyment having a cerebral to cerebral connection with a woman It can be very hot But leave those questions and that assessment until later

The following will get deep very fast

There is a concept of connecting first to a womans feeling her soul gut femininity goddess romance vulnerability theres more too since women have gorgeous spectrum

And then theres connecting to a womans brain ala a cerebral to cerebral connection Its super easy to do this with an Alpha Woman who thinks first and feels second just like a man who leads with masculine energy

Do what you like but recognize that most women want a man to connect to their feminine energy  The peril of a brain to brain masculine energy to masculine energy connection is that ultimately often years down the road it will exhaust a woman and cause her to build resentment because she discovers her femininity hasnt been fed and she WILL find a way to get it fed which will require the man to adapt quickly quite unfamiliarly live unhappily together or get divorced

Yes of course this doesnt apply to everyone and there are differences in how it applies but for the vast majority of people it does

There are all kinds of books and articles about masculine and feminine energy As a smart guy you may enjoy the power of gaining this knowledge",0,1351

1 Your profile pic isnt very good Yeah you listed that youre 18 but theres no reason to be advertising it It makes you seem really young Unless youre doing that for comedic purposes or something Id suggest a closeup of you smiling instead  

2 Id remove  Im free saturday night from your bio because it sounds like youre saying that to every girl ie a bit desperate 

3 I like your cheezit line but I think you could make it funnier Consider I got two kraft mac etc etc and exactly 16 cheezits to my name Followed by a line prompting feedback about that maybe something along the lines of hbu but not literally hbu Remove the part about running out Point being that the goal w your bioquestion responses is to get someone intrigued enough to swipe right and initiate a convo about xyz 

4 Id swap out the group pic w another It looks really fun but there are way too many people to pick you out quickly My eyes went to the guy on the right first instead of you Also note that group pics w guys will have viewers comparing you to the guys in degrees of attractiveness while ones w girls will have ppl wondering if theyre youre gfex even if theyre not So try to find a group pic where youre obviously the center of attentionthe life of the party 

5 Ive seen the question response about the word epitome quite a few times now so Id recommend changing that question or response to something more original

"It comes down to your level of comfort and risk tolerance OP Its tough to give you a definitive answer one way or the other because it comes down to a lot of personal beliefs on your end

That being said I generally err on the side of caution whenever communicating with a stranger over a datinghookup platform Personally I dont send nudesshirtless picsdick pics etc because Id rather form a more genuine connection over the phone and inperson first and it kills the vibe for me But if youre strictly looking for a hookup then maybe youre more comfortable with sending pics back and forth Once you confirm the person is real youve eliminated a portion of the risk associated with communicating via picturesvideos but this person is still a stranger

It ultimately comes down to why you would be afraid of someone blackmailing you over one shirtless picture Are you more afraid of being catfished or ghosted here Are you afraid she only wants a hookup Afraid she wont like you The easiest way to avoid these questions is to find a principled stance one way or the other and roll with it with every match If youre okay with sending shirtless pictures to someone over a dating app even if theyre 100 real youre still incurring the risk of her not responding ghosting or using it for more nefarious purposes",0,1303

Most importantly I am quite popular with girls in real life

I get some very hot matches on tinder especially when i boost i got a lot though admittedly most were not in my area and were using the passport mode also weird I used to get quite a bit of matches on bumble in the first 34 days and I paid for premium and spotlight maybe that is the problem Now I literally have 0 matches since a week and I have no clue why Again admittedly it could be that I am using travel mode to the city I live in currently physically somewhere else But still I am puzzled Should not be this low Definitely not going to extend my premium membership",0,984

1 I would change your and to or As in wines steaks or whiskeys Just because its a lot less daunting for a potential match to know one of three things than all three of those things 

2 I personally think talking about your adventures is hella cliche but it may work for you just judging from the number of times I saw it on womens profiles when I was on bumble

Weve discussed this before yes all of these app have deceptive practices to entice you to spend Tinder as Ive said before I was a match shareholder from IPO until last year is definitely a bad actor and one day the government will look into these platforms but right now its the Wild West They will hide matches until you buy a boost or something of the sort will overstate matches and will show your profile outside of your criteria to entice matches and spending to find out you need to left swipe them all So yes if you think youre getting screwed you probably are If you think youll do just as well being a free member you wont etc But if you were to pay to see your beeline Ive heard of some profiles being hidden until you pay or at least held back for longer but youll probably see a bunch of desperate women that they showed your profile to no matter how far well I mean not 1000 miles but way outside of your criteria that they identified as chronic right swipers to show a profile to in order to show some likes As for being completely wrong not sure about that but youd probably be disappointed with what you found Remember these apps arent to get you laid or married thats what they tell stupid people they have one purpose and one purpose alone To suck money out of your pocket Obviously they allow free users to keep the user base up just like ladies night ladies get in free because everyone that chases them will make them tons of money,0,1452

bumble does a great job of weeding out this behavior A joke may be a joke but you got reported and its easier to ban someone than risk the site being flooded with girls who were just joking about accepting cash for nudes You should have just reported his behavior first and been done with it",0,413
WTF,0,3
Lol ok,0,6
"Its just bland Id assume you arent boring in person so perhaps figure out a way to introduce your personality into the profile 

Also I know its anal but Id fix the grammar an introvert looking for an introvert 

The mullet could decrease your matches especially combined with a bland bio The other issue could be that many introverts like me want someone more extrovertedoutgoing However that may not always be the case so Im not recommending changing what you want out of life Just one possibility if you arent getting matches",0,528
"I dunno do you want to date an idiot

If its just for sex by all means let it slide",0,83

I guess I didnt fall for it I was suspicious when she asked me for pics in my underwear I dont mind sending a shirtless photo Thats not very compromising Plus shehe hasnt demanded any money Good chance they know what they have got is not going to be enough to extort me,0,269
Did you get any new likes,0,25
I am not defending his shitty behavior I guess the thing is if you were truly offended by his behavior why even play along,0,122

I assumed it because most posts come from men But could also be he is not the one Or whatever the preferred gender identity is Man yall too easily offended Also the OP could be texting a women,0,192
Are we not allowed to have nuances in conversation Okay someone can report this and then a actual person reviews it and sees its a joke Stuff Ive read online said a person reviews before they ban How did I get banned for this when it was obviously a clap back,0,259
No Hes right Cant get angry about it now,0,40
"Thats exactly why I said it to illustrate that point You made that initial assertion in response to nothing Im showing you why its irrelevant and pointless

What attitude Like I said before quote exactly what I said and what attitude its associated with

How did he message first ,0,25
you would be amazingly shocked at how many women approach men with these solicitations You were most likely banned because of how common it is Sorry to say I report and block every one hoping bumble will do exactly this,0,219
Often probably half,0,19
Thats how Im feeling Its really sad if thats the case Shes always reactive and each time I somehow ask how shes doing the most she says is thanks for checking in Just keeps saying thanks for checking in,0,202
No why,0,6
"Online dating I mean just dating in general is a game of volume its all about finding that needle in a haystack We dont have algorithms on our side to optimize who we match with so the only thing we can really count on is appearance because thats practically first impression

You win some you lose some Its better to give effort not receive any back and move on rather than half assing it all the time and pushing someone away who might be worth the time This is a game of perseverance and consistency",0,502
Sounds like you can laugh about it,0,34
Are you engaged or married,0,26
Although the thought of me potentially being used in a porn ad does not sound great But thankfully the pic does not have a super clear shot of my face,0,150
Its was a joke made when I was feeling frustrated with this being the way men approach me This was his first response to me I am allowed to clap back But of course I get punished So yeah lesson learned Keep my mouth shut when men are rude and disgusting Block and delete,0,270
Were on the app to meet people not be pen pals There are also a lot of women who are just bored and use the app for attention and validation so meeting up ASAP helps to weed them out and not waste our time,0,205

Precisely,0,9
"Urgh I hate the nonstarter conversations I limit my chats to one iteration at a time but as I get very few matches I guess that works However the art of conversation is completely lost on some people 

I matched with a girl a while ago and the conversation was so natural and fluid it was  refreshing I think you can get an idea if you will click with someone quite early on in messages

As a cinephile my favourite question is to ask someone their top five movies I think you can get a good feel for someones vibe from that Also if they reply with I dont really watch films Im outta there

Good luck out there OP",0,613
"Try video calling rather than pic exchanging If she is interested then surely she would want to see you virtually atleast if not in person If she doesnt want to video call then I would take that as a red flag as it could suggest she is not who she claims to be 

You could also just duckduckgo random underwear pics and send one of them instead would reveal true intentions soon enough",0,385
Then you can possibly laugh at them if they try If you need to you can lie and say covid cut your work hours etc,0,112
nahh stop telling them the truth its not what they wanna hear ,0,62
Well thankfully the photo is not enough to blackmail me with Its just a shirtless pic and because Im a dude its nothing more than what could be seen at a public pool,0,165

Youre learning that online dating in general is really just trash Put yourself out there in real life and I guarantee you someone will have warmer reception than this shitty app I actually emailed Bumble feedback yesterday to help solve the bs with arrogant people or people who just dgaf because theyre now public on NASDAQ and considered a leader Because of this they need to lead by example and show it,0,405
No My profile is basic and low quality,0,38
Like I said it was just a shirtless pic nothing too crazy And she sent me a pic back but Im still really cautious She saved the photo in the chat but Snapchat allows people to delete messages even if they were saved by someone else No notifications of screenshots or the photo being saved to her camera roll,0,307

"For starters dont send anything youd regret going public you dont know the person or what theyll do The pics should also be back and forth you sent a shirtless pic so she should be sending a revealing pic

Yes it is Trust your instincts on this one Girls dont like dick picks and are not going to request them before you meet Block her more likely a dude and forget about it,0,168
I know I feel like these apps just give the undesirable men a place to act like idiots So frustrating Sorry for your frustration,0,128
I think I know the first date OP,0,32
This,0,4
The shitty thing is some people get bored and just want something to do while they wait for something else Its disgusting but loads of people do it Dont chase her Dont chase anyone If she doesnt reach out to you dont go chasing her down If she cant put effort back into you then find someone better Dont settle for that bullshit,0,328
Im 34m been bumbling for about 8 months I can tell you from my experience it all boils down to sex atleast from until the point two people actually meet Im on the flipside of this as a male my looks must only be average based on who matches and talks to me I used to think I was atleast an 8 but Im matching with less attractive girls Before anybody roasts me I know life is more about looks but for me on the app I want to talk to girls I find sexy Just reality,0,462
Unless you cant get hard from them having a low iq who cares,0,60
Theres a lot of validity in this Definitely a lot of fronts and some bare bones effort Possibly as a way of not being too invested or trying to seem cool Sometimes I just look at profiles and think is this who you are who you want to be or what you think women or desired gender want you to be  Im in a different age group but it still goes on I swipe left on about 97 percent of the guys out there Thats from my Beeline and main feed There is something to be said for meeting someone who runs in the same circles with similar interests and lifestyles Its been hard to get out there for a lot of us dt COVID and for me living transiently As things slowly get better I think thats the direction Im going to take Plus in real life folks are more apt to act right Not everyone but its just different when someone is directly in front of you,0,837
Yeah well he needs to go along with whatever to get that pussy if he wants it,0,77

The majority of people are experiencing dating fatigue Being jaded from sucky online dating experiences and this pandemic have a lot to do with it Cant wait to be able to meet people in real life in outdoor settings like bars concerts events or parties,0,252
I love how when they say Hi it becomes Your move,0,48
Sounds like you two should go on a date ,0,40
The worst thing is when you are clearly compatible based on both of your bios and you give an extension but they just ignore you,0,128
Also Ive found my friends whove actually gotten into relationships with people really had to dig to find the person thats really there You really have to try to like the person It feels kind of forced even if you both end up liking eachother Where the people I meet irl I like them pretty much off the bat and I feel comfortable with them,0,338
"Honestly I thought it was a me problem for the longest time I know how to hold a conversation I ask questions to hope for more thorough responses Even those like how was you weekend should at the bare minimum get a good how was yours But generally not Ive tried to subtly hint at that in my profile about structure of conversation hoping that one person might read itno that was a foolish pursuit 

I think its a few things either people generally dont know how to maintain a conversation arent really interested in the other person or just simply conceded You may just have to move on form those people

"You know its really hard to put into words So if you dont mind Im gonna kinda ramble while I try and put it into words Im also writing this first thing in the morning to help me wake up so if its messy my apologies Ill revise later


First of all I think what Im going to say is somewhat unique to me because of where I live and my preferences I live in California in a pretty urban area My type is a busy person who is sure of themselves and who they are super in tune I prefer people who have goals that come from having passions rather than following goals they feel like they have to achieve 


For lack of a better word people here dont feel genuine Its not a totally bad thing its not like theyre trying to be fake But most of the people Ive met off dating apps dont seem sure of themselves they seem like theyre doing what they think theyre supposed to be doing They dont seem as mature emotionally as Id like Theres too much game playing and not enough transparency with their intentions and desires It feels like theyre afraid to put those out so they put on a front 
Theres also this weird vibe with a lot of the guys here I love a guy with confidence but everyone my age 1826 seems to have this weird narcissism Its not always super big or bad but it feels like its in place of a natural healthy self love The people I meet naturally who arent on dating apps and dont use social media a lot just feel different I dont mean to be on a high horse by saying that its just my experience
I will edit this later  Im going to go back to bed instead of waking up lol",0,1569

I expect a conversation more than one word answers yes,0,54
"Maybe its just that guys who suck are on the dating apps forever So you are guaranteed to find these guys The good guys come on the app meet someone get off the app 

So you have to play the numbers if you expect to find someone on dating apps Or maybe you need to find a different way to find people 

I deleted all my dating apps Im focusing on work until the pandemic is over Then I will get out in the world with the hope to meet someone",0,441
"Not confirmed by Bumble as someone else already mentioned they play dumb and do not admitacknowledge something is wrong confirmed by me Thursday night I had a beeline of 50 new account I made that day Friday morning all were gone Since then I swiped through many tenths of profiles and had 0 matches

I also plan on making a new account this weekend question is  will it happen again",0,393
Memegif convos can be very fulfilling if you already have something established  If its a new match instead of unmatching immediately Id try to steer toward human words after three since they may have just gotten carried away and taken it a step too far or maybe the unnaturalness of time rot has happened,0,305

She could have been asking and just not put a question mark Depending on where your mind or body stops aging could impact the answer This is more like an ice breaker question anyway and the response doesnt really matter so I wouldnt risk making someone feel foolish trying to get an answer to a question I dont actually care about If I were interested in her Id move along to the next topic if I wasnt so interested Id just not respond anymore,0,443

Im very introverted and seem to always date and get along best with very extroverted women I think something about being very thoughtful and deep is a turnon for some extroverted women youre a puzzle theyre trying to solve But when Im with an introverted woman the conversation is dry and I feel awkward trying to carry it Id be down to date a fellow introvert but its harder,0,375
Better make her an offer she cant refuse,0,40
"Actually Im assuming thats confirmed by Bumble

If thats the case Im giving my socials to the matches Ive been talking to consistently and Im deleting and remaking my profile",0,174

But why does keep going on dates with me Why does she make out Why does she come to my place After I asked her when she deleted her account she said I enjoyed last week too and I hope we can keep this going I see her on Friday again I dont know Maybe I should ask her again whats going on and be direct about it,0,311
How are you finding the people on the dating apps to be different or not the type of person you are looking for I hear similar things but Im not sure myself,0,156
Totally agree and the fact that she is not super responsive by text either tells me shes not prioritising you The person youre dating should make you feel good about yourself Id move on,0,185
Your pretty even blurred so I guess thats good at least lol,0,59
The real answer is Bumble is a swipe based app which is more looks focused by design Hinge and OKCupid are messaging apps so your opening message can help give you an in,0,169

Im 23M and if a girl actually messaged me I always tried my best to keep a conversation going and was mostly met with what youre experiencing from men older than I Im really sorry youve dealt with that its really not fair Im currently off all the dating apps I got tired of them,0,278
youre not going to get a fairytale match leading to marriage if you complain about men on dating apps two days in,0,113
"You do realize that I can use the exact argument against you right Your friends and a couple others dont make up all womens experience Besides Im the woman and youre the guy here Im sure I know more about the womans experience that you just based on that fact Again sorry to burst your bubble Aaaaaaand again this is the EXACT same attitude but with the genders reversed so its completely relevant

And dude youre the one here complaining about a simple and innocent hi And you say IM the negative one Seriously get a reality check Youre the one thats asking for high effort from COMPLETE STRANGERS on the internet so yeah that reads as entitlement on your part Strangers do not owe you anything get off your high horse",0,719
"Hi someone else mentioned it has been buggy these past few days However I can say that for me a premium user the number is accurate I can see likes and swiping left on someone in my stack who is already in my beeline will reduce the bee count by one When it goes up by one sure enough theres a new like at the top of my beeline 

Im sure you know this but changing your filter settings will also change that number as it reflects the number of people whove liked you and currently meet your criteria",0,499
I get matches very rarely on dating apps but I never ever got on dates form any of them and very rarely got a reply from a girl to just be ghosted Also the fact that on bumble tha girl had to text first doesnt help at all cause usually the girls do not like making the forts move especially on average or sub average dudes,0,322
It helps a lot when you explain beforehand to the person thats important to you But figuring this on my own and then unmatching first and deleting when asked is weird to me She didnt bother,0,189
Its funny how you know the gender based in experience on the app,0,64
 This,0,5
"Personally I choose to unmatch on bumble and move to phone numbers simply because I dont think its necessarily for us to be able to see each others profiles especially when this includes location data and whether or not either of us has changed anything or been logged on  its really easy to get into your head when you have access to this kind of information 

The differences is that I have this conversation with the person Im dating and let them know before doing it and my reasoning",0,487
So many people in the world and our collective mental health is getting worse Many think they want to date then either realize theyre too scared or just dont have a clue how Many at that age are relatively newly single and dont have clue how to have a relationship with a partner some are jaded because of their own lack of insightfulness to themselves and they blame others It seems like it should be easy but were all so scared to just be ourselves online dating ends up being just like walking into a bar but worse,0,517
This appears to be a Bumble server issue,0,40
"Lots of other threads about this  looks like it happened to everyone

This is why I stopped using Bumble It was basically impossible to get any matches because it wouldnt let me use any of my good pictures It wouldnt accept a really nice picture of me sitting on a boat where my face is clearly visible but it will let me post a picture of me with a dirt bike helmet on Sometimes I wonder if Bumble is just trying to tell me Im ugly,0,362

"Its weird hearing the same issues Im having coming from the other side 25M myself 

From what youre saying the only problem just seems to be giving energy to people that dont deserve it Rule of thumb if by the third or fourth message theyre still giving dry replies just unmatch No sense stressing over it 

Youre doing what you should be Keeping the conversation afloat charming introductions Just keep doing you and youll find someone that does the same or at least thats what the preteen emo music I listen to tells me 

I wish you all the best luck",0,552
"Agreed would swipe right 

OP keep in mind that the average personality of a Bumble match is AT BEST roughly as interesting as the average personality of any random person on the street In reality its probably even worse than that Keep at it",0,241

Not lazy at all Theyve taken initiative to show interest and say hello exactly as in a real scenario If you dont respond to a hello then you should post that in your bio with your reasoning Otherwise you may come across as more lazy yourself and submissive and demanding which is exactly what most women are trying to do so you wouldnt be doing yourself any favors,0,364

What attitude Quote exactly what I said and what attitude it pertains to

That same someone who said that has apologised and realised there was no attitude 
I didnt say I was owed special treatment youve made that up completely

What youve done here is interpret what Ive said through your negative goggles and made a bunch of assumptions that are completely false Youre now arguing a point thats irrelevant to the post Look at the actual question and what Ive said",0,621

As someone already said stop having this oh Im so important attitude youre not the last Coke in the desert youre just a random stranger on a dating app No one owes you special treatment at that stage After a while if youre trying to keep the conversation going and ask questions its ok to complain if the other person does not make the same effort yeah sure But at that initial stage youre a complete stranger and the person on the other side is too Complete strangers dont owe you some kind of special treatment just because youve swiped right on them",0,850
Ikr I had a mental breakdown during the night because I was feeling like Ill never meet the right one,0,101
Yeah you can always sort of feel it when the conversation is going well I find thats when its just random nonsense and not just and exchange of information about each other and asking for their number feels natural It is also odd I think at least to ask for a date when you havent exchanged numbers,0,298
Yeah without the pandemic Id consider it maybe the next day but the world has changed a lot Im almost fully vaccinated so hopefully I can begin going out a little more We all have been so sheltered the last year,0,211
True This is normally what I do  we make plans in advance and talk or facetime for a few days However this dude I made the post about hasnt answered so far so we will see what happens today I can bet hes probably moving on already which isnt a bad thing because clearly we werent super compatible right off the bat,0,314

Plus like I said before if she turns out to be not interested and you let the match go youve really lost nothing So you only have something to gain and nothing to lose by trying to get a convo going I know its annoying but gotta push through",0,858
"Ill take it then that in your personal experience a hi hasnt matched up with how interested they seemed to be later on Some were and some werent

Its mot anything wrong with you or anything youre doing wrong Sometimes ppl just arent into each other and thats going to be the far bigger  than someone who will be super into you Not to be that guy but are you kissing these guys or anything more Sometimes for us we think if theres no physical stuff at all that the girl isnt into us or that maybe they just dont like taking it slow Not that you should ever do something youre not comfortable with or be pressured into anything ever bc you shouldnt But there are plenty of guys who just dont care to wait or maybe theyre talking to and hanging out with girls who do show more physical affection and they find thats what they like You just gotta be upfront about everything including who you are as a person and keep putting the effort in until someone comes along that is into you 

All that said maybe try to ask them questions about what they like and try to talk about that Guys like girls who talk a lot just jot when they talk about stuff we dont have any interest in Guys are also super unused to compliments and girls taking interest in our interests If you do that you will def stand out",0,1511

"Apart from the other commenter said its no one job to help you overcome  it People have their own problems and lives Us women would obviously rather date normal sane men than angry women haters nor helping them and ending up shot or raped or worse as a result

No most girls say hi or send a gif Not being good at starting a convo remember girls are almost never the ones to initiate that stuff in real life and so many havent developed that conversation starting skill That in NO way is indicative of a girls personality or if theyre a good person or good potential gf Dont have this attitude that youre so important that girls need to blow your mind with a super interesting opener Respond and see if the conversation goes anywhere If shes boring the convo will be boring and you can end it then No reason to cut someone off for not being the best first line creator in the world,0,620
"Youre absolutely right  most guys become slightly better looking with good photography

Unfortunately in the world of online dating a 10 is a 10 and an 8 is a 2 The number of men who are going to jump from below average to slightly above average to fucking stunning with better photography is so small as to not be worth the time to discuss

Again youre completely correct Quality photography is important Its just perhaps worth considering that it might be less influential than a wellmeant observer might guess",0,512

Online dating is great for having more potential ppl to meet but its also a nightmare bc now everyone feels like they dont need to out in effort bc theres always more options They think its now on other ppl to impress THEM and theyre suddenly the prize or some sort of playa they never had the nerve to be when you had to go up to strangers in public before online dating",0,540

"gt What does everyone think here

A lot of men including myself have had the experience that every time the conversation is paused or the app is closed theres a very real chance the conversation has died forever

With that in mind I would venture to guess hes trying things to get past that Meeting up quickly is as you say absolutely a cause for concern during a pandemic

If you want to text with him for a few days first perhaps consider telling him so and offering something a little more substantial than Bumble chat to show you mean it",0,541
I think bc girls get so many more matches per swipe than we do that they dont want to have that many convos and sometimes you get left behind bc of the time limit to message Its the big downside of bumble that you have no control and no way to make yourself stand out with a good conversation starter Lol its meant for girls to have control and avoid some of the creeps but then girls seem to all not all but yeah almost all just say hey or send a gif,0,451
Haha it always blows my mind that a guy would join bumble and have to wait for a girl to message first just so they can blow their chances by saying shit like that,0,163
"I dont think theres a too fast at all What if you send 12 messages a day back and forth for two weeks Youve sent maybe 28 messages and might think thats comfortable enough to hang out Now what if you message all day and he asks you out after 40 messages Is it too soon bc its only one day 

What if you send a bunch of interview style what do you do for fun What do you do for work questions that arent really indicative of if you would get along Is that enough compared to having a real flowing back and forth banter with fewer messages 

My point being that its not about how many messages you sent or how long it took to send that many messages Its about how comfortable you feel with each other and if you are feeling like its too soon then its prob too soon If you agree to the date you might feel uncomfortable going in and thats gonna hurt your chances of having a good date Tell him you want to exchange numbers first and talk more Or if you make plans push it out a week or two and talk in the time leading up to it That way if he doesnt keep in touch you can cancel the plans",0,1085

"Youre not doing anything wrong some ppl just are boring as shit and its good to weed them out up front Youre old enough sorry lol to remember having to hit on ppl at bars so you should realize that its a newer thing to have this many options This makes ppl lazy in regards to how much effort they need to put it When you had to go build the courage to approach a girl in public hope there was one at the exact location as you you find attractive hope that she is single and open to being hit on and that her friends arent going to shut it down bc they arent being hit on the sheer amount of effort that took made both parties more willing to try to push through any early on awkwardness or missteps Now everyone has this attitude of I have all of these options so YOU need to make ME feel interested enough to stay talking to you 

It also has all of these guys who never had the nerve or skill to pick up a girl in public think theyre all of a sudden some slick pimp And thats not helpful for women online and why they get a slew of idiotic repetitive pick up lines and unsolicited dick pics",0,1092
These kinda guys on Bumble are such snowflakes honestly Theyve  spun the purpose of the app completely to being all about women making the first move and having to impress them just with some opening lines Ridiculous Theres tonnes of other reasons why women are using this app and I can assure you guys its not essentially about women being able to make the first move like you guys are trying to make it out to be  Given the time constraints as well since weve got only 24hrs to respond and no harm getting the ball to roll from a hi Why do guys think were wasting your time just by saying Hi You guys are making a mountain out of a molehill,0,642

Not everybody on the app wanted to find a relationship some just enjoy the moment that someone swiped on them some are catfishingetc Many people just wanted to use the minimum effort to get the most nothing wrong about them it is the fault of dating apps mechanism It feels hurt in opposite side though

Yeh sounds good Ive started to give them the benefit it of the doubt after he first hi but more often than not they are still quite bad at talking Thats why I was curious if this was a common link so I could cut them off at the hi instead It seems its not that common though so Ill likely continue engaging them,0,311

37M here Yeah seems fast Last person I had a relationship with we texted back and forth for 2 hrs after matching and I asked her out A person Im seeing next week I chatted on the app for 2 days a long message per day  But then again the point is to get off the app and meet IRL,0,277

Thanks haha I have been using it on and off for a year I stopped when I have been let down too many times and get my selfesteem hurt,0,132
Like a lot of people have said already you should always respond assuming youre at least surface level interested in this person because you never know what could come of it Ive gone on dates with girls who have started the conversation with a wave that went well But take it as a bit of a yellow flag not red necessarily and dont be surprised if they arent interested in you Its low effort for sure but you never know,0,418
Good luck having girls to admit that They literally beleive no guy is above their league,0,88
"Youre not doing anything wrong I really think its pandemic fatigue and apathy 

I was last on bumble about three years ago 4243 at that time and honestly I couldnt keep up with it I went on dates with so many great guys before I met my ex thought he was the one but thats another story I was going on five dates a week and couldve gone on more if I wanted Nice guys handsome guys interesting people from all walks of life I made some great friends out of it too 

Im experiencing what youre describing  the vibe is just dramatically different this time around I havent changed that much so I have to put it down to the state of the world  its just a really different energy I really wouldnt take it personally Ive decided not to",0,728
Happened to me too,0,18
It cannot be,0,12
Good luck having girls acknowledge this In their world there are no leagues that apply to them anyway and any girl no matter how ordinarymediocre looking can get any model or local hearththrob Girls are never encouraged to think along these lines and only told to follow their dreams or something You cant blame them fully for this Guys have much lower standards for casual sex and hookups so would talk to flirt with respond favorably to literally any girl causing girls to overestimate their league,0,500
They didnt  I had a couple recent ones at the top of my beeline which were wiped out as well I never even thought about it but youre right they cant have done that on purpose I think Bumble fucked up big time,0,208
The only thing left to say is goodbye right before you hit unmatch,0,66
I like that a lot Im doing it thank you Just got thrown off when she responded to something else entirely Like a politician lol,0,127
But I didnt ask what age shed like to be forever,0,48
Yea thats true Just threw me off to have someone respond to a wholly different question,0,87
Also it really messes with your self worth Peoples standards are so skewed on dating apps that people may view you as a second choice I find the people I meet naturally view me as their first choice or actually feel lucky to have me in their life I dont mean that in a conceited way but people youre romantically involved with should feel that way You shouldnt be with someone whos just eh about you,0,399
"Because you exclusively swipe on guys who conventionally hot and are way above your league They are in top 510 percentile in terms of looks and have every girl messaging them 

Have you tried to swipe on guys who are your equals  looksmatch",0,240
Honestly I thought this was an exaggeration but after 5 years and a bunch of dates Ive realized how right my friends were when they said no one you want to meet is going to be on dating apps Maybe 1 or 2 but its not likely Youre not going to meet the kind of people you want to meet on there Thats not to say anything bad about having a dating app just the people who happen to be on there arent the best Ive found much more luck with throwing myself into my community and doing things I like and joining groups or volunteering Then you find your people and inevitably find someone who likes you If you havent tried that already thats what I would do,0,650

I use that hypothetical a decent ammount I used to say aging instead of deteriorating with age and a lot of girls thought that would freeze everything about them which is a stipulation I didnt intend So I figured this is clearer but noone has ever misunderstood like this,0,271
Im also a hier Theres a few different reasons for it a theres nothing in the profile for me to grab onto b bumble only gives you 24 hours to send a message before the match expires and I dont always have the energy to come up with something creative in that timeframe and c Lots of men dont respond even when Ive put the effort in for a curated opener so Id rather wait to see if theyll respond first before digging in Lots of people just swipe out of boredom ego boost whatever and I figure if someone is actually interested in a conversation with me theyll take the 2 seconds to say hi back ,0,593

Not to take sides here but your approach was very direct A simple where are you from would have sufficed All of that additional upfront context before the actual question set you up for the response from her Ive been here too mate But also probably not the best match for you anyway So I guess it worked out,0,307
"Im a female so take this with a grain of salt if you want to 

I definitely think that on Bumble when the roles are reversed a lot of women dont necessarily know how to start conversations What I think is happening is that they still have those expectations of a man must hit on me but since I have to start the conversation Ill let him carry it or its possible that theyve never been in a situation where they have to be the ones to actually start it so it ends up with them kind of being halfassed about it I think that if you want to respond then you have to treat them how you want to be treated annoying I know since theyre being lackluster if that means going oh hey____ hows your weekend looking Or hey _____ tell me about the band on your shirt in this photo then you should do it But only if you truly want to",0,818

"I had no luck on hinge also Ive tried plenty of dating apps and I find bumble to be the best at least of youre looking for a wife candidate I cant speak for those wanting hookups though

In my experience its harder to get girls to match than it is to get dates Once you get em in the door really all you have to do is keep the conversation flowing then eventually ask them out 

If youre sending messages back and forth throughout the day day after day shes Into you Its really that simple If shes sending you good morning texts shes very into you 

Its no coincidence that Im successful on bumble I never had a gf in highschool and multiple times I failed a new years resolution to get laid Im not sure if youre familiar with the term but I did my best to MinMax on bumble Did a bunch of research on what works and what doesnt etc etc It paid off 

Heres a few tips it would take quite awhile to write out all the tips and tricks I use 

 Unless Shes the one who initiates never ever text your match while turned on Close the app rub it out and then go back to messaging Just trust me on this one

 Your profile pic matters more than everything else in your profile put together times 2 Theres plenty of resources on google on how to get the best profile pic

 You gotta have a good reservoir of questions especially those that prompt her to talk about herself Ask about her goals her hobbies etc The most powerful question you can ask is What are you passionate about I usually save this as a lifeline in case the conversation starts dying Walls of text are a good sign If your getting single line answers and shes not asking you the same question back thats a bad sign If you feel you are the only one driving the conversation then shes either not really interested or not a quality woman",0,1791

As a female I dont care what the political party says on a profile but you have anything in the bio that says to keep swiping if I am not aligned with the beliefs then its an automatic swipe regardless of the political affiliation However in my experience with OLD the guys that had a conservative on their profile have turned to be jerks after a certain period time,0,366

Funny enough one of them showed up in my queue today and I swiped right  not a match He liked me a few days ago so either he hasnt seen me again or he did and assumed I didnt like him back first time around and swiped left So that match may be potentially lost for good So maddening",0,710

Whats actually happening is that men hit their peak SMV in the mid 30s And women do in early 20s So basically you as a regular woman beyond age 35 will have same experience on dating apps as men do before this age Welcome to the dating world from a perspective of a 20 something  early 30s man Not trying to sound cynical here but this is just the reality,0,355
Damn I hope you removed her,0,27

"In my experience because you put no effort whatsoever into the opener Ask a question make an observation actually give me something to respond to 

Theres no point in the women speak first thing if you dont use it to have the conversations you want to have and just typing hey  doesnt do that It puts the onus on the responder to actually start the conversation",0,361
That has been on me in the past but more recently Ive been giving it my all and still the same story Im pretty sure girls will do ANYTHING to not have to lead the conversation that or theyre on for validation,0,208

If he is short with his answers when I attempt to engage a real conversation I move on I have been guilty of just starting a conversation with just saying and no luck with it or it works itself into an actual conversation I guess it depends on the two people talking and where it goes,0,284
Consider matching as nothing more than locking eyes with someone at a bar and exchanging a smile Its a moment of admiration that might lead to something or absolutely nothing at all If you think about it the same could even be said if you chatted with that person at the bar too Dont expect things to lead somewhere until they explicitly do Otherwise its just looking at strangers,0,380

"By the way one more question I heard that if you uninstall any dating app your profile is still active so you may still appear in others swipe menu My question is what location does Bumble use then If its no longer in my phone it no longer has access to its location so which one does it use Perhaps the last location before the uninstall And that means I dont have to constantly stay in Italy until I get a match and instead spoof into Italy once open up Bumble and let it sync with the location then delete Bumble then come back to my country and delete the location spoofer as well Just an idea though

Thanks in advance",0,623

Depends on rule 1 and 2 obviously,0,33
its pretty simple folks if a person matches with you and doesnt send a message or reply or does reply but its lack luster guess what thats someone you should stop worrying about and move on stop giving energy to people that dont want to give you back that same energy dating apps are a dumpster fire we all know that,0,316

"I read full bio and still sometimes just say hi or hey I dont think am lazy and I dont have a quirky line every time I start a conversation and I dont not talk to a guy if he just says hey 
I dont think you can always measure based on that But I might be alone in this its more what follows after If I get response in two days its clear you cant be asked Thats a sign for me",0,374
"I always reply to women when they messaged me on Bumble 

I have matched with a few women and they never message me If the woman doesnt message first on Bumble then there is nothing I can do",0,190
Like I said icebreaker but from what I am getting from you is to forget the HI just bring it on ,0,96
We cant reply if you dont start the conversation,0,48
I agree the way op wrote it in the title had me under the impression that she wrote in her bio her height if she just checked the box in profile setup i can see that just seems very odd,0,185
Aww thank you so much  Not creepy at all and I appreciate the compliment,0,72
Im a woman and its happening on my side too Honestly at this point I think these people are only searching for an ego boost and nothing more,0,140
Like literally never or it happens more often than youd like,0,60
Oh no Im definitely not of the mindset that this is a competition because at the end of the day we can only control ourselves right My phrasing should have been better But your point about being authentic to yourself is interesting Ive been hearing that a lot and its something I will definitely do thank you ,0,309
Yeah Im definitely not a hunter or a fishermen so I wont be posting anything about those things But yeah to the 1st paragraph I have heard from multiple women that they are not attracted to men who play the victim and thats definitely not my mindset Thank you for the well thought out response this is really helpful ,0,317
yeah i checked out OPs previous posts the part thats confusing is a woman that makes a profile and leaves the bio blank minus putting the height which is something men do OP also used they pronoun so for some reason OP is either trying to hide the gender of the person or that person goes by they pronouns its unusual because its not something we see on this subreddit often,0,374
"Op seems to be a guy

And as for height its possible to be lazy and not complete profile for either gender Its basically just something you check off when creating profiles anyways

And im def one to make sure height is displayed before anything in my profile because im taller",0,277
Warning to all  hes a very horny boy who posts his weiner to the public,0,71
I mean maybe But if Im juggling several conversations I prefer to know where to focus my energy I try to go through and respond in the order I received the messages but I dont want to necessarily count someone out if they arent as great at talking to strangers on an app as they are at opening up to people irl Some people are slower to respond but have enough to talk about Other people are quick to respond but dont seem to know how to drive a conversation anywhere besides down a dead end road Or theyre just there out of boredomneed for validation but still Idk maybe Im just doing it wrong,0,594
yup,0,3
Thats great advice thank you Im an avid hiker actually and I have some selfies from the trails Ive gone on and to the first paragraph I agree with you Ive been seeing a lot of responses saying that It seems like a lot of women on here appreciate honesty in a profile so this is something I can build on ,0,303
"
Conversations tips if the girl has info or an interest have that question reflect that It wont always work but if a girl likes you and its a fun topic that can start a conversation go for it Then remember it all depends how fast the convo and flow is but dont go beyond like three topics without setting up a time and place date 

If she likes you then she will accept and offer a day that works for both Its more work for guys but dates will appreciate a dude who can setup a date with details Nothing big find a place close by to your date maybe share a plate of friespizza and drinks keep it casual and easy for both parties If you guys hit it off on the date then you can setup a date with an activity or something",0,719
Sure wont,0,9
Aw man sorry to hear that happened to you What did she say in her text after,0,76
This is definitely helpful thank you It gave me some added perspective talking about things that make you comfortable would seem to make her feel more safe around you thats great advice ,0,186
False this is the guys POV,0,26
People have numerous reasons to not reply sometimes I personally dont like talking to multiple people at once and when I get overwhelmed I think it may be better to ignore the first message rather than tell them Im not interested later No one is entitled to a reply back from someone else no matter what they say,0,312
"Oh no   
So it happens on both sides huh",0,40
Hey it will be allright Tomorow the sun will come up maybe you can go outside do something nice for yourself Nicer days are ahead,0,129
Its strange but hes still a dude lol,0,36
I mean it goes both ways I wont necessarily ignore a guy just because he only says hi but I definitely dont have high expectations from someone who gives minimal effort,0,168
"I wouldnt go as far as that I literally meant ALL you say is Hi Then the man has to conduct the conversation and if he stops talking it dies Like were a circus clown or something that needs to keep them entertained

In the matches I had that went well it was a twosided conversation Both starting subjects Its awesome when it happens that way",0,342
"Youre absolutely doing the right thing sorry if it sounds creepy but i checked your profile after you said you had a pic and youre definitely good looking so I wouldnt worry about the looks department

If I wasnt so much younger Id definitely shoot my shot lol Keep doing what youre doing and youll definitely find a guy soon",0,325
"Nope I got a free 2 week trial and then it renews at like 70yr so I signed up then cancelled before the trial ended Im willing to occasionally spend some money and save time on an app thats 15mo for access to people who swiped right but Im not paying 30mo to do the same on here 15 is hard enough to justify to myself

Edit sorry 673 mo on Bumble",0,346
 a lot of girls match and dont say anything to me,0,49
My experience all dating apps are seen as dating apps by women and hook up apps by men,0,86
"yeah but when have you known a woman to put only her height in her profile  

op can be a man and i guess matched with another man cause again what woman have you known to leave her profile blank besides her height like ive never heard guys complain about that never seen it on the bff side of bumble none of my friends have ever spoken about it is that a thing",0,361
Except their looks Thats all they need to bring to the party Now entertain me,0,77
"Definitely be yourself Steer clear of what annoys you and what you dont want 910 times youll get what you dont want when its a list on your profile Focus more on what you bring to the potential match Tell us what you like perhaps the ideal date or an evening as a couple scenario keeping it less about sex  more about comfortable things you miss or prefer in a relationship 
I hope this helps I personally hate shirtless photos and find them sleazy in case you wanted to post something like that Happy searching",0,511
For me its not the same but there are more creepy guys on tinder haha,0,69
why the girls never reply,0,25
"no need to come out with the insults  

if op is a doode this is strange again i have never heard of a WOMAN putting just her height in her profile thats something men do so the only thing that this could be is a guy matching with another guy whether he knows it or not

have you seen women with profiles that only list her height",0,342
Ill give u some Wait i dont have hope left either im sorry,0,58
I unmatch people that just say hi or hey,0,40
It sure could have but at the end of the day OP cropped the message off theres more text going that they arent showing,0,118
Who uses the word deposing lol,0,30

You responded really great btw Hope you get better matches",0,466
Omg this is me,0,14
I replied and then got stood up ,0,32

Hi name is rude I guess And no questions I guess he shouldve just started by saying I like turtles,0,98
Im a hi er  it doesnt mean Im disinterested It will lead to more if the chemistry is there The truth behind my hi if the guys profile is difficult to comment something funny on Ill respond with hi Also I hate making the first move,0,230
I think it was just a joke I got a giggle,0,41

Op is male,0,10
Exactly You get it Id rather tlak about movies or embarrassing middle school storiea,0,84
"You may be right but Im not so sure Im having the exact same experience with Bumble as OP 

I put up my profile for a review and the feedback was positive Im confident my messages are not the issue  I was on Bumble a few years ago and super successful with it and my style of communicating hasnt changed since then 

I get lots of matches but the conversations are like pulling teeth Slow responses matches expiring cant seem to get someone to meet up for a quick coffee etc 

Seems to me there is a total sense of malaise and apathy with people on the apps right now OP Im not sure where youre located but in my area we are on pretty severe lockdown and limited to 12 close contacts only Im starting to think that whereas in normal times men would be open to chatting with and meeting a lot of people theyre slow playing because they may be talking to someone else and dont want to interact with more than one person physically In normal times it was okay to grab a drink with multiple people in a week but right now thats just not doable",0,1039
Also what kind of therapist would take referrals from OLD Ive gone on dates with a couple of guys who turned out to be therapists I didnt even find out they were therapists til we met in person They were diligent about making sure they didnt run into any patients onlinebecause of how career endingly illegal it is Im not secure enough to date a therapist but I sympathize with how hard it must be to date,0,405
Ok good luck to you,0,19
insanely busy schedule,0,22
Mmmm yeah cant help you then,0,28
I dont think shes ghosting it seems like just busy,0,50
I dont know if thats 100 accurate they still might not respond with enthusiasm so i dont think attractiveness has to do with it,0,127
"I saw this response from someone a few months back speak on your profile to the typequality of person youre trying to attract 

Dont put negative remarks on there Think about what qualities make you uniquedo you like hiking collect unusual trinkets are you passionate about something

Make sure you have some pictures with you genuinely smilingnot forced or fakelookingand keep the group photos to a minimum",0,407
"Dont be negative Some men write about exs that they hate shallow people they get messed around on the app It feels like theyre already moaning at you and strangers moaning at you is weird However you can talk about your dislikes if theyre weird they could be a nice talking point 

Any pictures of you doing something youd like to do with a partner  its easier for us to imagine what it would be like spending time with you another reason the fish pictures are a turn off 

Do tell us what qualities you look for in a woman and what you think are your best qualities

Thats not Bumbles problem or any dating apps Its called the internet people can fake their location their gender their looks their personality their nationality what they own their basically entire identity its not the first time Have you heard of someone blaming dating apps that catfish happens Even if you did sometimes that would be a useless thing to do

Also PS I actually tell in my profile that Im from Armenia so Im not sure if Im faking my location publicly Theres nothing unfair there

"Please

Refer to line 4 

Obviously you cant blanket a whole sex doesnt mean women cant be raised right from the jump or cant learn from being used only once to understand what they want long term Were talking about the majority here again weve got the data now to show the typical trajectory of the typical woman Personally Im glad you were level headed all the way through but let me offer you this Did you grow into puberty and your teens with IGTTOF 

Bring a child to Walmart tell em to pick out candy and hand em 3 quarters Its easy to pick from 3 maybe 4 MAX Now bring them back the next day and hand them 3 Benjamins Just Imagine   Again not every child will break every benjamin but theyll certainly be tempted and why would they go for the cheap chocolate when they have enough for the good stuff

I get that the main rules havent changed for growing up but we aint gonna act like social media hasnt had its prominent effect for both sides A young woman right now doesnt even have to have a model body or face is capable of conjuring attention left and right Back in the 90s you basically had your school district to choose potential love interests from until college this new open market has offered young women the ability to connect with guys from literally anywhere So not only has the market opened to its limit but make upskin care have also advanced 10x toss in all the countless marketing to women like those tiktok leggings to make em sexieretc 

Women are already shown to swipe for guys 37 years older these older men are simply more established This is the quality chocolate These are also the guys you wouldve come across 10x LESS back in the 90s This isnt about shaming women its about understanding them

"This is impossible to answer without seeing your profile stats and pictures But I will give you my best answer based off the results you said you are having

Bumble is a site where the woman has to make the first move 

If you are matching with men contacting them and then receiving very little interest  Then it is 95 likely that its because of your pictures and stats 5 because of what you wrote in your bio

You didnt have a chance to do anything wrong yet

The only error you made is going after men that are not looking for a woman like yourself 

And that is ok you dont want a man who is not looking for you

If this sounds mean Im sorry but these are the simple fact 

There just isnt enough info for it to be anything else 

If you were highly attractive great bio and stats A man would respond to you with much enthusiasm Since this is not happening then you just have to do the math

Hope that makes sense and sorry I cant be of more help but all I know is what you shared

I wish you happiness Good luck to you",0,1023
The two people are more than likely people who were in your radius when they swiped on you but arent anymore Thats been the case for me,0,135
Be funny if you are and make your profile reflect your voice as in who you really are Actually write something other than I like to work hard and play hard which is so cliche Gym or shirtless selfies are a turn off unless youre looking for a hookup Girls actually read profiles We look at pics too so they all shouldnt be super far away or totally outdated and like someone said just be you Thats how you attract your match A boyfriend I met on bumble said after he got to know me he thought my profile was not representative of me and had some cute lines but wasnt true to who I am or my interests He was right When we broke up I completely changed it and attracted so many more potential matches Good luck,0,707

"Shes just rude You dont say hi to someone first and when they greet you back give an uhh hi it implies an annoyed tone Why are you annoyed when you said hi to me first

Ive read your back and forth with the another person and I disagree with you completely The person who started the convo should have continued it A normal convo would have been

Her Hello
Him Hi Person 
Her Hows your day going What are you up too 
Or whatever 

He turned me off personally with his next comment of  Not much in your profile Can you tell me something interesting about yourself He could of had a general question like  how is your day going Or  love your hiking pics Where is your favourite hiking spot  or whatever he could gage from her pics But who knows he was props turned off with the uh hi and therefore responded in that way 

In normal interactions the tone and body language would tell me if the person is actually not interested in talking to me not merely saying hello back Its just a greeting and it doesnt mean the person is not wanting to engage with you socially The person who says hi first has to carry it What was the reason you approached Carry the damn conversation Ask about the weekend Say its been so long since you last saw them Something 

You cant say hi first then be silent and expect the other person to carry the convothat would be really awkward",0,1362

There in nothing new you can inform me about I know all about you asexuals and demisexuals but I do not like people enforcing other people to think in a certain way And also judging other people for their way of being is also pretty scummy Dont know why you explained your whole sleep pattern to me Sex is pretty vital for normal and sexual people just because you cannot see it or understand it doesnt mean you should judge people for that I do not understand you demisexuals and asexuals nor will I judge you and criticise you so please try to not criticise us as well Just so you know sex can pretty much be vital for your mental health as well if you sre a straight sexual person I personally have to go to escorts from time to time just to lower down my depression because well women are not attracted to me so I have to pay for sex I am a very sexual person and I need sex to stay sane and think normal Some peoples brains work like that and you do not have to understand it or judge it Maybe this guy is the same as well most normal sexual men cannot stay without sex more than a few months otherwise they get all moody This is how humans work,0,1150

"Please STOP asking them

Women CANNOT or WILL NOT tell you

Bro you have to understand that women want different things in men as time goes on Young women are currently encouraged to have frivolous fun once theyre done they look for another kind of man If you believe when women tell you to be nice and respectful that theyre talking about the first half of their sexual experience   no

GRANTED this isnt ALL women but the statistics on these dating apps back up what men already expected decades ago they will date up with more established men So if you actually WANT a good shot at having the same amount of innocent fun as the modern young chick then you need to establish what grabs their attention the most and this is Looks amp Status 

Hopefully you spent all that alone time building up muscle dominant traits and a career so that you can now invest the time to build a proper profile with 35 pics all diff outfits amp diff places taken by a PROFESSIONAL Dont forget to photoshoptouch em up If you need 3 inches to get to 6ft then by all means put socks in your shoes amp all that jazz Your goal as far as bio is concerned is to put the LEAST amount of deal breakers as possible 

MOST IMPORTANTLY
as a man your value starts rising around 30 and expect your peak to be 4555 if you play this game of life right By that time youll get over caring so much youll be way more comfortable with yourself and you should have enough investment in your job that making money will be your main prioritywhich is what women overwhelmingly respond to This means that if youre young you should be focusing on that 50K job and even towards a 100K one if you have the brain capacity",0,1674

Any conversations that start with hi or hey for me already signal to me that I need to carry said convo and thats not my style I usually tty to start convos off with a comment or question,0,187
Yup same thing on my end Seems like a bug for the time but honestly who knows,0,77
Bumble only shows you to people in your current country Which is super annoying for people who live close to a border such as someone in the Netherlands not seeing people in Belgium If spoof your location to Italy and then subsequently set your location back to Armenia you will no longer show up for those people in Italy you swiped on Swipes dont reset when you change countries so you should show up again to those people if you spoof back to Italy,0,451
"Youre so wrong its not even funny If I run into an old friend at the coffee shop and go Hey man And they just say Hi Im going to be extremely caught offguard assume that they dont want to talk or dont like me and then likely try to keep the conversation short since they clearly arent interested in talking If they reply with Oh hey man Long time no see you know like a normal human then Ill actually think they want to keep a conversation for more than 20 seconds 

Saying Hey What are you up to isnt putting the conversation on you its just not being an emotionless shell 

Try it sometime youll be surprised how much better conversations go",0,643
I was referring to the fact that you basically said if youre not keeping them around for dates you can always keep them around for personal needs Which sounds to me like you just use people for your own personal gain if theyre not interesting enough in any other way,0,266
I am tempted to start matching with those just ask profiles and be like why should I ask you over the hundreds of other attractive guys who actually have bios,0,158
Just be Chad and if you even have to ask in the first place its already over,0,76
I mean like are you attractive in the face Are you tall  Muscles is just a looks multiplier,0,91
Ill try that I guess,0,20
This is why I just never swiped on people with zero info in their profile There has to be something for me to go off on No hobbies No interests Boring I think people need to put more effort into their profile if they want more matches and interesting conversations Whether people wanna agree to it or not a profilebio is like a job or college application Its their initial selling point If its not good or interesting than it probably wont get picked Sure some people might swipe if they think the persons really attractive but then you just run into issues such as this one being cute isnt enough for me to swipe on someone personally,0,635

Im putting the conversation on the conversation starter its not up to the greeted to start the conversation Literally how hard is that to get Its not lazy to put the conversation on the conversation starter its lazy for the conversation starter to put the conversation on the other person Youre literally assbackwards on this,0,325

"That may be fine for you itll likely not seriously affect anything in your life With that said I dont know if I can recall a single time someone has said nothing more than Hi in response to me Its weird It leaves an opportunity for a very weird awkward silence

Its a common idea in social psychology that doing things like being the one to ask questions especially in first interactions leads to the other party having a significantly higher opinion of you than if youre more passive in the interaction Ive literally read books that discuss this 

But go ahead and be lazy and just keep putting the conversation on the other person",0,632

Literally all my conversations start with hey then hi Why would I greet someone and expect them to start the conversation Im starting the conversation but Im texting a greeting to see if theyre available Im sorry youre socially inept I dont expect redditors to have social skills ,0,280
"Usually the first one to talk is getting the attention of the other in which case a short hey is preferred After that why just say hi Go  try that right now with someone Theyll be a little confused for a second before then asking you something Its just not how social interactions typically go Not that I expect people on Reddit to have a high EQ

I try to say more than just hello no matter what to avoid that whole thing in general",0,433

Im not talking about dating either Im talking about normal everyday conversations You reply to a greeting with a greeting Thats how it works Usually the person who greets first is starting the conversation So why would the greeted person have to start the conversation Thats pretty backwards,0,291

Im not only talking about dating just greeting people in general Any time anyones ever replied with just hi and not Hey Havent seen you in forever or Hi sorry Im late or Hello how are you It comes off as them being antisocial or pissed off or not wanting to talk,0,262
Uh hi is 910 a red flag for me,0,30
You typically reply to a greeting with a greeting So Hello followed by a hi is a normal interaction,0,99
"I try really hard not to let politics get in the way of me connecting with people I have liberal friends and made sure that I didnt let politics get in the way of that Im honestly disgusted that weve let politics drive a wedge between us as people Im 41 years old and Ive never seen us more divided as we are now as a country If were closed off to multiple ways of thinking how can we improve How can we become better Its my firm belief that we have to be open to all possibilities and all thoughts and not just completely shut down views that are coming from particular partymind set that we do not like or agree with 

Love each other and simply try not to judge  I know its hard at times Im a Christian and I try very hard not to judge my fellow human beings As far as your response to abortion I dont have to agree or support your decision but Im also taught not to judge you So maybe not swipe left on all christians ",0,922
Lol well good luck w that its noones job to entertain,0,53
I know you mean that jokingly but also why try to get to know her She doesnt have any info on her profile at all so why bother messaging someone who doesnt have any interest in putting in effort,0,194
True but the best indicator of how someone acts or will act is what theyve done in the past For example with domestic violence abuse almost never starts at the first date its a gradual process as someone slowly reveals their true self Yet if a new partner could look at someones past to see these red flags they could avoid entering into a problematic relationship to begin with Some people can fake their true nature and intent for over a year so its important to thoroughly look at someones core values and how theyve applied that in the past,0,544
This was done to show that women DO like the huge roided up physiques on men that are unrealistic and unattainable for 99 of men Women these days have just as unrealistic beauty standards for men that men have for women,0,219
Sounds like a personality disorder,0,34
I feel in this case its on her to follow up w something though She couldve responded w almost anything to spark a conversation Theres no steadfast rule saying any gender has to start off the questions in a conversation,0,218
So There men who dont go crazy for me the way they do for women on all those gone wild subs Whats your point There will always be someone more sexually attractive than you me and others Its a fact of life That you have to run social experiments on a dating app to tell you that and then you writing a post on it says a lot about you,0,332
Thats his choice but he didnt put in any effort in his first message Saying hi in response to hi without anything else like asking a question or whatever leaves her with basically nothing,0,187
Ahhh makes sense Never had an issue though and thankfully all of those apps have been deleted,0,93
Ahh ok that tracks then yeah he totally shouldve left her alone after the uh hi,0,79

Wow thats a lame convo lol,0,26
Youre talking to a stranger its noones job to entertain during an initial conversation Its supposed to be simple basic convo Hes lucky she said anything at all after his uh hi I mean cmon first folks bitch about saying only hey then they bitch cuz now tell me something about yourself  is wrong too I say fit and leave it at hey If telling the truth and saying his profile is bare is aggressive he shouldnt be OLD,0,413

you actually made it unnatural with that question really did turn it into an interview like dont waste my time what makes you interesting sounds like youre not much fun to talk to,0,179

Maybe they were bots and scammers Women I know myself included would swipe left on this kind of profile and this type of guy",0,244
i get it but replying to hello with just another hello and nothing else would make me unmatch its halting the convo putting it on me to find something to say and i never start a convo with just a hello unless i have nothing to go off on from their profile so they should say more than hi back idk op seems as uncool as the guy saying uh hi,0,339
What a dumpster fire of a convo Unmatch like yesterday,0,54
Ok that was a long reply lol sorry I just cant sleep its 8 00 am and I havent slept yet Idk why normally I get 1216 hours on a normal day but I had nothing better to do since I cant sleep and I probably couldve worded some things better but Im a bit loopy from not sleeping so I say whatever is on my mind so I said my veiws more then usual thats probably why it looked like I was trying to force things on u sexuals either that or u assumed I was but I can assure u I dont do that to normal straight people I do know that what I say here isnt going to change anything and I dont try to change people just inform them and normally I do try to understand them I just cant completely sometimes with stuff like that since I dont see sex as a vital need I dont judge it tho just hate harassment which is very common in our culture because of people feeling that its a vital need but my points may not be completely clear to u since I brought up sexuality into this most my points arent based off my sexuality tho its based off what most sexual people have told me or what Ive been taught statistically by a teacher who knows what theyre talking about but I dont think it makes any sense to u it makes sense to my sexual and asexual friends tho u dont have to reply to this Im not expecting u to just trying to clear up any confusion,0,1328

Same here about the Beeline I agree its glitchy because my friend had the same issue with old profiles last night,0,113

I basically said this further down and I have so many downvotes Thinking of a better opening line other than hello is simple to do Nobody male or female likes going through the monotony of pointless dry texting I mentioned he could have asked her what her favorite course was in her major Thats gold to start a conversation that could lead somewhere Do away with the pointless intros,0,383
Standoffish i like this word,0,28
Eh she obviously sucks but the tell me something about yourself question sucks and really does feel like an interview I always asked back thats really broad what do you want to know You should really be asking about something in their profilepictures and if they dont have that you shouldnt have swiped in the first place,0,321
Right All these downvotes for what Telling men they need to have real conversations with us to get in our pants Let me try to get them to understand Im helping them If you go to a bar and want to sleep with at least one of the ten women lined up at the counter would say hi tell me about yourself to each and every single one of them in that order Fuck no you would try to start a real conversation Do that or keep saying hello beautiful its your choice Enjoy your blueballs,0,474
The best thing to do is to just ask someone up front where theyre at instead of looking for clues Hopefully theyre honest with us too But if youre confused  ask If you want to do a video call ask for that too If theyre cagey and dont have proper answers for you then thats an answer too,0,286
This If you want to see them set your search distance to max You can always unmatch if they are too far away,0,108

"This guy is a dick but females do this to guys all the time Just start with something light hearted to get the conversation flowing and then you can slowly ask questions just like you would when you meet some one for the first time in person 

Something I do is Ill pretend that my best friend and I are having a discussion and that we need her opinion to decide once and for all Then Ill emphasize how critical the situation is and that her opinion REALLY matters After that I ask a bullshit question like does pineapple belong on pizza and viola youve started a conversation 

Hope this helps",0,594
You forgot the s,0,16
I think short of the matching process it doesnt matter Conversations should just flow the same for everyone once matched Some people spend money to get super likes some dont some use super likes after the run out of normal likes for the day It doesnt necessarily mean they are any more or less into you,0,302
Exactly Itll come up sooner or later having it as a really early question is so annoying Especially if they find it interesting and now thats all youre talking about despite you just finishing a shit ton of work and now just want to talk about literally anything else,0,267

Consider asking a more targeted question like What do you like to do in your free time Or Do you have any special talents What is one of your insignificant accomplishment that makes you the most proud You can get some of the same answers to your original question but are giving the person answering the question a place to start free time talents insignificant accomplishments
Finally responding to a dull answer sounds like a job interview with hostility is not worth your time It puts the other person on the defensive even more and at that point youre better off not responding because youre not going to get a good response and there are so many other things to do in your life that you could be doing instead",0,1088

I just looked it up number one cause and I wasnt asking for a source cuz I dont believe u Ik not everyone is demisexual I just figured if ur giving out a statistic u might have a source and I was curious about the statistics cuz I get curious about a lot of things but u made me have to look it up on my own But even if theres no perfect definition for a sexless marriage everyone seems to agree that theyre common Newsweek estimates that about 15 to 20 percent of couples are in one and sexless marriage is the topic of myriad new bookslike YagerBerkowitzsand plenty of articles and columns  httpswwwthehealthycomfamilyrelationshipsaresexlessmarriagesmorecommonthanwethink and theres the source for that reddits not letting me copy links in my text like I normally can
Also so u know Im not saying sex isnt important which isnt what I said at all I just said its not as much for some people that wasnt even my point in the first place my point was that this guy is impatient theres a difference Im not enforcing demisexuality either but I did the research on the marrages failed due to lack of sex too for u In 15 of marriages the couples have not had sex for the past 612 months This lack of intimacy can pose a real problem The marriage turns into a platonic relationship and one party typically has built up feelings of resentment or anger causing the marriage to eventually break down httpswwwmarylandlawhelpcomhowintimacyissuescanleadtodivorce but as u can clearly see thats way less then financial problems u actually dont know marrages 
And that girl shouldnt have to change anything about herself to find a decent man a decent man will really just care about intamacy and intamacy doesnt always have to be sex and Im not saying it CANT be Im saying it doesnt HAVE to be Im not saying that U CANT DO IT Im not JUDGING U FOR THAT Im saying everone is different I never enforced anything u just took it that way cuz ur sensitive asf and Ik u are otherwise u wouldnt be getting defensive about it that I said anything cuz I clearly did not say that all people are demisexual I did not say that Im judging u and I did not say that any straight person should change I just think that guy was falsely advertising himself and insensitive about it",0,5003

"The answer I feel is more options in the dating filter than Men and Women I understand why Bumble probably took a stance against people filtering out matches by sex gender identity etc but the net result is that the sort of assholes OP keeps hearing from are lumped into their match decks   
Bumble might not like the idea of people filtering others so narrowly but why should OP  who has been completely upfront and honest in their profile  have to put up with nastiness and bullying from people too stupid to look elsewhere in the first place  
Whether people shouldshouldnt filter out members X Y or Z criteria is a separate issue Overall though Id rather see members like OP be able to rely on only being placed in the match decks of people open to meeting so this sorta crap doesnt keep happening to them

In anticipation of someone coming along and trying to accuse me of anything I will state again my suggestion is based on getting assholes to selfexclude not on any ideological judgement of anyone Im appalled by what OP has had to put up with and it needs to stop immediately 

Wider search filters may be the answer Then OP doesnt have to check with every new match that theyve bothered to read the gender and doesnt have to keep dealing with being reported by the idiots that dont Ive suspected for a little while this sort of thing was going to happen just based on the fact that Bumble gives wide latitude to us to decide who we should be shown too but not the the equivalent filters in the searching direction

well but if you dont have many matches its worth making a decent conversation out of it if not for a date you could always get to know their profession etc and use that to your personal use when needed For eg Ive had matches with a therapist dentist architect and all have come handy to me when needed we never went on a date but its good to get some information on demand if they choose to exchange numbers,0,407
"There are fucking great photos dude the only very slight downside is one of the reasons they are good is the background is great and you are not the key feature I dont mean that negatively on you just less ideal for dating profile 

3 for main profile maybe slightly cropped to focus on you A main profile pic must be clear primarily you and a good representation

As for others 4 but not the second pic on profile as its a glasses shot you need to have given good opportunities to see full face before that comes up

As for others 789 and 16 Think those are a good mix

My general advice for pictures is clear good quality and primarily you for main photo then the following one activity shot one sun glasses max one low key with other people ideally not with you draped on a women Dont repeat outfits if possible as you dont want people to think its been a single effort 

Obviously the hard thing is I dont know you and Im sure you have a better feeling on which pictures you like and represent you best But from a neutral perspective I think they all look similar in terms of your look another key thing is dont have pics that make you look radically different because people will always focus on the worst of them  not the best You dont seem to have so thats fine",0,1268

At the end of the daylike Ive replied to others Im not going to be compatible with everyone and even if it goes well for me it might not be going as well for the other person Continuing to push through and hope that Ill meet someone who is after the same things as me

What if the sex isnt good He waited 2 months just to find out that she is rubbish at sex or that she has a hairy pussy Honestly now sex is REALLY important in normal relationships he did the right thing in my opinion But you think what you want but could you kindly stop enforcing your demisexual views onto others Not everyone is asexual or demisexual and more than 50 of the population arent Thanks",0,2397

"Its been a year its totally fine to do that If you check Bumbles support website they have an entry about it and specifically say that its okay

They warn against doing it too often but thats targetted at people who are doing this frequently to try and trick the system Youre going to piss people off if they keep swiping left on you and you keep reappearing a day later every time

But I doubt people who saw you on the app a year or more ago are going to remember you when you show up again given that you didnt even chat In my opinion returning to the app after having been in a relationship is probably the single most legit reason to do a reset",0,649
I really hope it does because people who do that are one of the reasons these apps are such a pain to use,0,105
It is about showing affection mate You really do not value sex at all dont you You really see it only as a wya to please men It should be both ways A man wants to feel affection physical affection from a woman and if she takes her sweet time to show that then that man will look for it someplace else Easy as that,0,313

It might be the thing where you say that you are chatty and outgoing but I really doubt it If I had a date that was more outgoing than me I would either really appreciate that or if it bothered me  I would communicate that  and let her know what I feel

"Assuming youre after a relationship rather than casual dating be yourself fill out your bio and questions and show dont tell with your pictures

What people find attractive in other varies so dont try and aspire to looking or acting like something you are not people looking for the fake image you create will only be disappointed when they realise youre not really like that and people who would genuinely be attracted to the real you will swipe left if theyre not into the image youve portrayed Being yourself will get you higher quality matches more likely to go somewhere

Fill out you bio and look up advice on how to do it well avoid negatives avoid pointless fillers and try to showcase who you are Try to show dont tell here as well so instead of I like cooking which is true but very generic say your favourite dish to make  this then still shows you like cooking while also letting people know what you find tasty if its complex where the dish is from etc  it gives people way more to notice something in common with you and also more points for them use as conversation starters

Make sure photos are clear good quality and look like you  youre trying to find someone who likes you for who you are misleading images will only get you hurt by rejection Mix of face and body avoid group shots and try to avoid pets Show dont tell here too show yourself doing the things you like rather than just poses if you can  this is another chance to show your personality and hobbies without taking up bio space It also helps with conversation starters  if you say I like history theres less to jump from than if you show a picture of yourself at some ruins  the photo shows you like history AND you get out and do stuff AND the ruins  so people get more of an idea who you are and the image becomes an easy conversation starter

I actually noticed that it tells me theres no more people in my area I dropped the age slider by 1 year and it showed me someone who met the original criteria and who were NOT new I reset the criteria to what it was and still had people to swipe on who were also not new

The app has been glitchy af
Ive had people in my Beeline and nobody to swipe on Then people timing out and getting a notice 3 days later to give them more time",0,613

"From the way your profile is atm we can tell that youre a creativebut if youre looking for a relationship and you havent had a single match in all that time consider switching up some things 


This is going to sound harsh but try and take it like a grain of salt You seem to have good intentionsyou just communicate yourself a bit poorly


1 Your profile pic that would be better placed towards the end Use a clear image of yourself pref smilingnot a selfie You seem goofyfunny but if you want to appeal to a larger audience your first pic has to be your best and not just a silly pic Otherwise people wont bother to look through the rest of your profile Dont cover your face with your hand


2 Your bio has grammatical errors and has a bit of a commanding tone which is unattractive Id strike the first line completely Then itd be a matter of reordering and rephrasing your bio So
A Only use exclamation marks when youre genuinely excited about something Otherwise it comes across as shouting Id recommend just 1 exclamation mark 
B Add an s to video 
C hammocks and Im trying to become a more wellrounded person
D Then move the line skip the small talk to the very end 

E Alternatively consider this rewrite 
I write films edit videos love swingin in sunkissed hammocks and am OBSESSED with books Im currently reading book name I aspire to be a more wellrounded person Lets skip the smalltalk and pretend were already friends ltstill a bit cringe but communicates your points a bit better 


3  Last point would be to swap out the pic w the girl w another friendgroup pic Even if shes a friendrelative someone viewing your profile might think otherwise 


Again Im not trying to bash you I hope this will help a bit",0,1719

"I dont think thats a weird compliment

The way you worded this sounds like you kind of panicsent 2 subsequent messages after the compliment before he had the chance to reply You dont have to send another especially because you changed the subject already  just wait for him to get back to you 

In the future it kind of ruins the compliment if you immediately apologize and try to play it off like you didnt mean it though Please sincerely mean and then stand behind the nice things you say to people

Its not weird to be nice to him if you like him He wont think its weird I think he would be happy to hear a sincere compliment

Hence the desire to not swipe on 300 instagram models and get no matches you tank your ranking

As someone with your own good qualities taking such poor care of yourself emotionally and being unkind to yourself as well as others who are on the app bodes poorly for your capacity for a healthy relationship with someone great Please kindly consider that and focus on improving YOUR life YOUR profile etc Theres always something YOU can do that doesnt involve bitterness and jealousy and comparison and wasting your time playing devils advocate

"Picnic date has work so well for me Ive always make it clear to the person Im talking to that Im not looking for a penpal So 3 days of convo will be as far as it will go without having set up a date

Choose a open place park preferably who has either a good view or something special 

Carefully prepare an ADULT picnic ideas Italian or Spanish cured meat assortment olives bread pre cut hummus and vegetables sticks boiled eggsall those are best enjoy cold a decent bottle of wine and plastic wine glass Picnic blanket and if it a bit chilly pack an extra clean warm jumper for her dont want the cold to stop your good time

Grab a coffee and show her why you choose this place ask her what she think if things are going well time to take out the picnic blanket If no chemistry well time to head home after coffee",0,814

"gtAnyone who gets turned away by that isnt worth dating or dealing with

You are thinking about it the wrong way your choice but your chances of getting matches will be seriously disadvantaged by this decision

You think that you are filtering out people who dont support those causes or points of view that is not it at all",0,324

"Honestly there were well over 50 but thats the nature of being female  a lot of men swipe right on anyone whos even vaguely attractive  I live downtown in a very densely populated city thats crawling with singles

Dont read too much into it These are likes not matches or genuine connections My method is to match with 12 people at a time who I pick from my Beeline and try to have a meaningful conversation with  a lot of the time they dont answer or barely engage So a lot of these men arent actually interested in me I just passed the cute enough to swipe right on test The numbers dont mean much",0,599

Thanks for the thoughts Yeah I think Id swap it out if I had a better one theres one that would be perfect but unfortunately I chose that moment to look like a total dumbass so that ones out but Im not going to just get rid of it or replace it with another solo shot,0,266
Ive had the same experience and my guess is that there are just more people and bots using Tinder in my area than Bumble,0,120
"If the convo is totally gone he either deleted his account or was banned If it was an unmatch you would still see him below your other conversations but showing as unmatched 

Normally I would say dont even think about going but Bumble has been super glitchy today Too bad its far away otherwise Id say just go with the intention of treating yourself to dinner and if he showed all the better",0,392
Maybe that was it No nothing yet still looking I suppose Ill get there eventually,0,81
Stop being so crabby Read the other posts here  a bunch of peoples beelines went empty overnight  I had 50 people in my beeline and now zero Its clearly a glitch,0,161
Yes they were likes but losing them all at once is not normal Youre telling me all 15 of them moved on and deleted the app when I was sleeping last night And I understand they werent matches Sorry for using the wrong word That being said Im not misplacing ego at all  has nothing to do with it,0,293
"Im off the app for the past 18 months

But I used to find it fun to swipe two or three then go back to the beeline and see if the listings shrank 

It was a mini game to see if I could damask the blurred images based on color averages in the photo Im swiping on It was actually kind of fun",0,289
"They were only likes then not MATCHES

lolthey probably moved on and there was no certainty you would match with them anyway Ive had x100 dozen matches with women at the airport or on vacation in my city

Misplaced ego and naivete with your approach",0,249

Yupp woke up this morning and find at least 15 pending matches gone Didnt know it happened to other people too Im new in this app so usually it wont disappear then,0,163
I am also M4F I was referring to the beehive I was farming female matches and waiting to match with them Because if I match with them NOW I pretty much have to start hitting it off with them within 24 hours after they message me I was waiting for summer before I match them officially and activating the 24 hour countdown,0,321

Ill definitely fill out the about me but the ACABBLM and pronouns stay Anyone who gets turned away by that isnt worth dating or dealing with,0,140
Hmmmm strange I only get 24hrs to respond to my matches when they message But Im M4F Not sure what your profile indicates,0,121
Yeah would have totally went with well I can print an application out and mail it to you Or you can instantly apply by calling phone number But dickhead here decided not to be clever,0,182
Why are you a good lair also,0,28
Ok this makes me feel better same thing happened to me today I figured they were punishing me for cancelling my premium,0,119
He was the one that suggested the date picked time and place I mean we were only talking for like 10 days so its frustrating but I wasnt emotionally attached or anything yet Oh well right,0,187
I also noticed a couple places where its encouraging me to buy spotlight that werent there before So maybe theyre clearing out peoples likes in some stupid attempt to encourage them to buy spotlights It sure as hell wont work on me  I paid for premium for a reason Super frustrating,0,282
well played take my upvote,0,26
Seems like that makes 34 of us Wonder if we will get them back I would assume not but that would be bad for premium sales,0,121
"Had a time and place been set Also did he you out or you ask him 
Unfortunately some people are just shitty and they wont think anything of setting up a date then unmatching I suppose the good thing is that he weeded himself out quickly",0,236
"Im female and active on the app and I have premium so I can see my beeline 

As of yesterday I had 50 people in my beeline and today its empty This is clearly a glitch or a tech issue not a punishment on OP for not being active",0,227
If you have a means of communication through a different means check on that Else no dont go he unmatched,0,105
"Happened to me too I had a lot of likes in my Beeline I have premium so could see all of them and as of today zero Im active on the app but tend to only match a couple people at a time out of preference 

I have to assume this is a glitch not a calculated move to punish you as someone else said",0,295
"They have a FAQ entry on it which claims it doesnt affect how often youre shown they just warn against overdoing it because it annoys people to keep getting profiles they already swiped left on and you might get reported

That your beeline is empty might have a different reason lots of people whose beeline was full suddenly noticed it was empty during the past 24 hours",0,371
My profile says Im a cat person The amount of guys who immediately resort to pussy jokes is exhausting That and the guy who said kitten pictures werent masculine enough for him,0,176
You get me Thanks man,0,21
Did it happen to you today Because the person above is also reporting it happened to them today which would make 3 of us,0,120
Oh totally Fuck him though lol if he didnt even have the guts to tell you he wasnt interested you didnt lose out on anything He wouldnt have been good to you anyway,0,164
"I am in the exact same situation as you I met someone that I thought could be a good potential relationship We hit it off really well from the first day and things moved fast with us because we had such good chemistry But after 3 weeks he just stopped texting and when I would text him I wouldnt get a reply until the next day or none at all It is so frustrating and I feel so disrespected and hurt Like we are adults so we should behave like one as well I am not afraid of rejection because it happens to all of us but what is worse for me is being ghosted by someone who I had genuine feelings for Like if they arent interested then just say so I have thought about texting him again but I end up rationalization with that thought and decided that he isnt deserving of any of my time andor attention It really hurts because I really did like this guy but both parties need to put the effort and if they arent willing to put any then its best to move on 

I wish you good luck on your journey and I hope you find someone special ",0,1030
Agreed Like I said to someone else above why cant adults act like adults Youre not going to hurt my feelings if after 10ish days of talking you decide to opt out,0,161
Lol Im a guy but youre right I was shy Was waiting for my summer bod to come in,0,79
Same thing happened to me this morning All gone Over 50 in the beehive gone  a lot I couldnt see because they were out of my area but ones in my area are gone too ,0,163
Yeah youre right If we would have been talking longer Id be more disappointed but it was only like a week and a half so nothing really lost Its just frustrating,0,160

Meh Bumble has moderators just like reddit They prolly said cut the crap and deleted all of them IMO with just cause Its sounds like  youre not following guidelines and messing around with the matches  subconsciously very shy and didnt want to send the 1st message Maybe you should just use Tinder to harvest,0,308
This is better than my experience a month ago where I got a no show at a restaurant Eventually we find someone that makes all this worth it,0,139
He did it in a pretty childish way  but by unmatching he has indicated that this date is not happening,0,102
I got this problem too i thought it was a bumble thing,0,54
It appears that way Oh well on to the next I suppose,0,52
A lot of posts like this at least lately Never go when this happens If theyd actually wanted to meet you they wouldve contacted you and told you so outside of the app postdeletion Assume the unmatchdelete  cancellation especially since you dont have his number or any other means of contact Pick up some good takeout by yourself and have a likely better night than you wouldve with him,0,385
